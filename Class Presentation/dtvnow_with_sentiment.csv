There are so many bad experiences on this sub that it's almost hard to believe.  I started with DTV Now when they launched and I agree it was a buggy, choppy mess then.  It was bad enough that I left and did trials with PS Vue and Sling for about 6 months.  PS Vue was far less stable than the current iteration of DTV Now.  When I came back, it has been pretty smooth sailing since then.  I have 3 FireTV Sticks (Gen 2) and a wired FireTV (Gen 2) that have all been pretty smooth sailing since then.  I don't see DTV Now breaking up or stuttering any more than NetFlix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, my local media server and is definitely more steady than my roof mounted antenna with HD HomeRun.

I even went on the Beta program for a few months for the DVR and the only thing I could ever report was that the app locked up on the welcome screen.  Once it was on, it was fine.

47,2018-05-23 02:08:23,VGinNYC,DTVN+AppleTV+HDHomeRun+ChannelsApp = Excellent Cable TV Replacement,"Hi, all. I've been a DTVN subscriber since it rolled out in late 2016 (still on the $35 Go Big Promo). I've been using an OTA antenna hooked up to my TV's coax connector to watch my local channels that are not available on DTVN. However, this has not been optimal since a) I would always need to pick up a different remote to switch TV inputs in order to access my OTA channels; and b) I had no online guide for my OTA channels.

After doing much research, I finally purchased an HDHomeRun Connect Duo ($99) and the Channels App for Apple TV ($25), and I have to say that I am quite impressed with this setup. The Channels app for Apple TV is everything the DTVN app should be! Easy to navigate, quick response time, flawless execution (although there is room for improvement). The Channels App was put together by a couple of software developers whom AT&T should have hired a long time ago!

Here are some of the features I enjoy about this setup:

- If you place the Channels App on the top row of the Apple TV menu, my Channels App favorite channels thumbnails (with TV show icons of what is currently playing) are displayed on the Apple TV top shelf. If I want to go to that channel and watch the program, I just select it from the top shelf.

- Changing channels on the app takes about 1 or 2 seconds for the picture to start streaming ... very quick! Note that I have both the HDHomeRun and Apple TV connected to my router via ethernet cable.

- You can pause/rewind/ff live TV in the app. The app uses the Apple TV's memory to store the buffer. The app web site claims you can pause for up to 90 minutes (I have only tested about 10 minutes worth of pausing, and I can say it has worked extremely well). Scrubbing through the video backwards and forwards shows the corresponding video segment, so there is no guessing as to where to resume playback.

- Clicking on the left side of the remote's trackpad rewinds the live stream by 7 seconds; clicking on the right side fast forwards by 30 seconds. You can change the number of seconds for both options in the config menu.

- No extra subscription fees. The Channels App provides 4 hours of TV program guide. There is a DVR option for $8/month that gives you a full 21-day guide, but I haven't explored that. There are other DVR options that work with the HDHomeRun unit if you wish to implement a DVR solution.

- Double-clicking the Apple TV remote play/pause button changes to the previously viewed channel. I wish DTVN did this!

Here are a couple of articles that explain my setup in more detail:

https://www.imore.com/how-watch-live-tv-your-apple-tv-without-cable

I am not affiliated in anyway with either HDHomeRun or Channels; I just wanted to share my OTA-viewing configuration with my fellow DTVN subscribers who may be missing locals in their respective DTVN markets. Of course, if you have lousy OTA reception in your home this post will not interest you, but if you have solid OTA reception, this might be a great solution for you.

48,2019-05-03 04:07:40,moricons_dll,*Guide* How To Sideload Apps (like Prime Video) on the Gen 2 Osprey Beta Box,"Just got my Gen 2 box via FedEx today and spent some time poking and prodding at it via ADB (Android Debugging Bridge).

USB side-loading has been locked down by AT&T via removing the auth activity required to give an app (like a file browser) installation permissions. On previous Android versions this was just a global flag, but in Oreo (Android 8) it's authorized per individual app.

&#x200B;

**The good news is it's still possible via ADB even without root:**

1. Download the APK you want from a safe source. (Amazon Prime for ATV is available here -> [https://rawapk.com/prime-video-android-tv-apk-download/](https://rawapk.com/prime-video-android-tv-apk-download/)).
2. Install ADB on your PC if you don't already have it -> [https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html) .
3. On your Osprey box press the remote's HOME key and select the SETTINGS ICON.
4. Scroll down to SYSTEM -> GENERAL -> SYSTEM SUMMARY.
5. With SYSTEM SUMMARY highlighted, press the OK button on your remote repeatedly until ""You are now a developer"" appears on the screen.
6. On the same menu, scroll down to DEVELOPER OPTIONS.
7. In the DEVELOPER OPTIONS menu, scroll down to USB DEBUGGING and enable it.
8. Press the EXIT key on your remote.
9. Get the IP Address of your Osprey box by checking it under SETTINGS -> SYSTEM -> NETWORK -> NETWORK SUMMARY
10. Connect to your Osprey box via ADB on your PC by typing ""adb connect INSERT YOUR OSPREY BOX'S IP ADDRESS HERE"" at a terminal or command prompt.
11. A box will pop up on your Osprey's connected TV screen asking for permission to allow debugging from your PC. Select OK.
12. Now type ""adb install INSERT APK LOCATION ON YOUR PC HERE"".
13. You should get a success message in ADB upon completion. When you're done installing all the APKs you need by repeating Step 12, type ""adb disconnect"".
14. For security purposes, it's best to turn off USB DEBUGGING in DEVELOPER OPTIONS once you finish.

&#x200B;

Your installed applications should now show up under ""Apps"" in your Home Menu.

Congrats! You now have a kick ass Android set-top box that can run just about anything you need.

Maybe they don’t have a login for the app you like but, really, no one likes that channel.

31,2018-07-02 16:57:07,,A realistic look at the DTVN price increase,"One thing that is different with this versus what companies like YouTube TV and Sling TV are doing..... those companies are simply grandfathering in prices that customers had before a price increase.

That isn't what the GoBig Promo was about when it first rolled out in 2016. The regular price at the time for the GoBig was $60 for the service, and they were offering people a limited time offer to get the GoBig package for $35, which was a $25 discount off the normal price, to sign up. Right from the first day, DTVN always said that the GoBig promo package would see the same increases as the other plans, but that you would keep your discount.

Now that the regular price is going up to $65, we are still keeping our discount...but now $25 off (which is what the original discount amount was for the GoBig promo) of $65 is $40.

Hey, I'm not happy about the increase either..especially since they are having issues with the locals and the DVR is still in beta.

But we all knew this was going to happen. They told us it would.

This is the first time they have raised their rates since they first launched. Vue, Sling TV (several times), YouTube TV, Fubo..all have had price changes since they rolled out.

We have a nice sound system, and it was extreme enough to rattle the windows, startle us, and cause hearing pain. Using my phone I clocked the average dB of the content we were watching to hover around 70, but would jump to an average of 90 dB during ads with peaks as high as 97 dB. I contacted support to report my complaint and concerns and they escalated my request and stated I should see an immediate resolution when watching shows.

Since contacting DTVN, pre-recorded shows no longer populate with loud ads and the countdown, and instead, standard ads play without the countdown, and more importantly, the volume issue is resolved. If you have this problem, I suggest contacting DTVN and express your concern about the ad volume.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/boutwp/psa_for_loud_commercials/,positive,0.2621

I've noticed general slowness moving between menus and apps etc, and figured that changing the animation rate would give a noticeable boost in UI speed. So if you want, follow the directions below and set your animation speed accordingly.

&#x200B;

1) Enable Developer options per u/moreicons_dll thread [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/bk483i/guide_how_to_sideload_apps_like_prime_video_on/)

2) Press the HOME key and then go to SETTINGS

3) Then go to SYSTEM -> GENERAL -> DEVELOPER OPTIONS

4) In the DEVELOPER OPTIONS menu, scroll down until you see the Window, Transition, and Animator duration scale.

5) Default value for these settings is 1.0x. I prefer 0.5x as the animations and transitions are still present, but quicker. You can disable to get rid of them entirely if you'd like.

While I love that DTV has more channels, the interface is just so far behind that of YouTube TV. I really hope the engineers look at the smart things YouTube TV is doing to improve the watching experience or they will be left behind as these alternatives to cable TV continue to grow in popularity.

* When watching live TV, swiping down on Apple TV remote brings up a list of the last three channels you watched. Makes jumping back and forth a breeze.
* The ability to customize the channel lineup is killer. Not just adding/removing favorites, but actually organizing the order in the list they appear.
* The load time when jumping in between YouTube TV channels is really about 5x faster than DirecTV.
* The Live TV guide lets you see live previews of the channel in progress, not just the name of the network

26,2018-12-16 14:11:40,,"After all this time, they still haven't fixed channels randomly dropping off the favorites list.","Ever since DirecTV Now first came out, one annoying issue I have had is that channels that I have selected as favorites become ""de-selected"".

Once every couple of weeks, I will switch the guide over to All and go through the channels. And sure enough, I always find anywhere from 2 to 4 channels that dropped off the favorites list.

It's always different, so it isn't due to a specific channel.

My hunch is that their system can't handle having a large number of favorites being used and it starts misreading them.

The way I use favorites is that I select every channel I could ever want to watch...not just my ""favorites"". This way I can permanently avoid a lot of the junk channels that I hate.

Has anyone else had this issue, or do most people only select 5 or 6 favorites?

24,2018-08-22 01:16:06,Alwayscur1ous,PSA: Roku guide can be instantaneous,"If you learn the quirks you can get your guide to load instantly AFTER the initial pull. 

So there seems to be quirks in how they decide whether to pull the guide from memory or refresh it. The first time you pull up the guide it takes a while to cache it to memory. This will also happen the first time you select favorites as a filter. 

The key to keeping it from reloading in it's entirety and pulling from memory is to always select an item once the guide is pulled up (even if it is the same channel you are currently watching). You can never pull up the guide and select back. Once you do that it refreshes the guide from scratch. 

Sometimes I notice the guide gets stuck when you pull it up (it won't let you scroll through it). You can't cancel out or it will refresh it next time and take forever to load. To get it unstuck simply select left while in the guide and go back to the right and it will allow up and down scrolling.

Can't promise that it's the same for all.

The box is designed to be turned off when not in use to conserve data since it streams automatically whenever turned on. So what you may perceive as a dead box might just be because it is turned off.

21,2018-12-18 14:42:42,mrdctaylor,I've been a Dish customer for ~18 years...Just started my 7 day trial of DTVNOW,"For me, the primary motivation is price. I've been a continuous Dish Network customer since 2000 or so and the prices just keep climbing.   The fights they have with the different broadcasters are irritating too.  We've been without HBO for over a month now.  Before they dropped HBO I was paying almost $150.  I'm still paying $135 for 3 old DVRs with the Top 120 package.  With the kids out of the house--and in college--it has been time for a change.  I don't think any of the services are 100% ready or prime time, but I'm willing to trade off for the cost savings at this point in my life.  


I've kept a spreadsheet comparing all of the streaming providers and their channels.  DTVNOW and PS VUE were the frontrunners.  I know VUE is supposed to be a better experience, but I'm concerned about their longevity.  Plus they don't carry my local Fox affiliate which I cannot get on an antenna.  So for now, DTVNOW is it.  I've been playing around with it for a day on my Roku Ultra and Roku Stick and I've got to say it is better than I expected.  Granted, I know there will be outages.  But I was prepared for it to be pretty bad.  But so far, so good.  The DVR is wonky.  And it is weird how the Roku App always starts playing A&E (first alphabetically, I guess), but it is usable.  And at a monthly savings of around $100 I can live with some bugginess for now.  The nice thing here is that I get sick of it I can cancel and switch services much easier than I could with Satellite!  That's another thing that is very attractive to me.  


I've lurked on this subreddit for a couple of months in anticipation of this.  Now I've taken the plunge--or at least a 7 day free plunge.  We will see how it goes, but I think I can make it work for $100 less per month.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/a7bmkw/ive_been_a_dish_customer_for_18_yearsjust_started/,positive,0.9858

Most of the people tolerate the glitches and bugs because of the content and price.  Meanwhile, they are getting ready for their main service, which will be a higher price but have a few more features (like an actual dvr that works with storage included).
They introduce the new service and start shutting down DirectvNOW by cutting channels and raising cost until enough people leave or switch that they can shut the service down all together, leaving the original people who took a chance on it in the cold.

What Im not impressed with is how annoying it is to change channels.  In my old cable setup if I wanted to change channels from cbs to nbc I would just click a 2 to 4 digit channel number into my remote.  In this new setup to do the same thing I have to click up to go into the guide which pauses my screen completely and then click the up or down arrow literally like more than 60 times (theres no page up/down that im aware of)
   
Ideally somethings like channel number support and page up/down functionality on the guide would help with that.  Although, I dont know how they would implement that on certain platforms like that dont have number pads.
   
I do realize that there are other options like using the favorites (which I currently have like 40+ channels in) or searching but those still require much more clicking than being able to input a 2-3 digit number.
   
Disclaimer: I think rental fees are stupid, Id rather own my own hardware.  I dont actually have the beta box because I missed the signup by a day, Its just the only option I’ve heard of that has channel numbers.

Recently went on a saving money kick, trying to lower ALL BILLS. (Internet, wireless, XM radio($6 month) etc)

Searched email for DTVN emails from when I canceled service 7/18. 

Noticed it says “You can always restart your account with the same package or switch it up and try something new.”

10 months later, kids bitchin about wanting to watch Disney stuff. 

Initial convo on 4/18/19 got it added back, the go big package. And was told I’d get the grandfathered price of $40. 

Follow up convo on 4/28/19 agent #1 from 4/18 didn’t add on the discount. This agent #2 got it all set up. And price right where I wanted it, no temporary discounts, nada. Even though #2 brought up the increase on 4/12/19, I simply referenced the chat log from agent #1, promises, and the date, being after 4/12/19 $10 price hike. 



It is possible to get it back. Just be polite AF. I was a early adopter and signed up the second day it was available. Try and build rapport. It goes a long ways, be personable too. Normally this is quite the opposite of how I am, I’m a driller on a oil rig and I’m a prick. 


Also worth noting, I still have hbo showing up as part of having ATT for no extra cost, no I’m not on the unlimited and more premium. I forget how I got it for free(signed up for att wireless in 10/18). Best part of all of this is simply: 2 iPhone XR, unlimited data, nighthawk workaround, and DTVN/HBO/GoBig all for ~$202/Month. Can’t wait for next month when I pay off the non free XR and it drops even more!",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/bj0745/there_is_hope_to_get_your_old_grandfathered_plan/,positive,0.7261

Mini review below.","-	Stream quality is similar to DTVN when it’s at its best, but a LOT more stable. My headaches of seeing DTV blurry and buffering is finally gone and was shocked to see how reliable it was on YTTV.
-	The UI is a lot better than DTV, a LOT faster than DTV. Also being able to reorder the guide is great. Never have to try to flip through a bunch of channels to get back to where I was and having all your previously watched always there is great.  
-	Having an extra streaming screen is great included. Never have to worry about being blocked from watching live TV in the house.
-	Pause/Rewind works perfectly and actually works with Siri on Apple TV and on My Android TV/Chromecast. Completely forgot how it feels like to do that again after the past few years with DTV.
-	DVR works great - not much more to say. 
-	Family sharing and profiles is great for your own DVR and Channel lists. Only problem is if you’re logged in on a TV client, I don’t see ways to change profiles without signing in and out.
-	I only have Live TV for the news and live sports. All the channels I need (besides BeIN) is here on YTTV, not sure what channels are missing on YT that is on DTV but it’s a non issue for me. 
-	Now that DTV is $50, the $5 HBO isn’t much a selling point anymore. Both services with HBO are now the same.

Overall YTTV is just a lot better than DTVNOW in every way. I wasn’t expecting to like it so much in the free trial and am planning to cancel DTV before the month is over. Honestly not trying to add to the angry mob on the service , but I honestly can’t believe now how long I’ve been supporting this beta test of a service.

20,2019-02-10 15:38:23,packetfire,"""Too Many Streams"" - Serious lag in replication/sync between AT&T Servers","I have 3 Roku Ultras in 3 rooms, and one account that is claimed to allow 2 streams at once.

Despite only playing one TV at a time, and taking great care to exit DirecTVnow to the Roku ""Home"" screen before leaving one TV for another, I am subjected to ""Too Many Streams"" errors, that persist for extended periods of time.

But, by running around the apartment like a madman, and starting DirecTVnow again, then exiting on each and every Roku, and then sitting quietly with a cup of tea and a book for about 1/2 hour,  I can then, once again, watch some news.

So, this implies 2 different problems (are you paying attention, AT&T employees?)  

&#x200B;

a) Data sync between servers is too slow - replication of ""active"" stream records are thereby different on different servers. 

b) Some ""exit"" events seem to be falling on the floor, and never being replicated to other servers, or not being ""caught"" at all, as the start app / exit app sequence on each TV seems to resolve the longer ""deadlock"" cases. 

&#x200B;

There has been a litany of complaints about ""Too Many Streams"" on all possible platforms, so this is not a Roku-specific issue.  I intend to log these incidents, and to demand credit for each and every day when this happens, thus cutting my bill in half.  If AT&T has problems of this sort, then they need to up the minimum number of streams to account for this lag in their server replication of active stream counts per account.  

&#x200B;

I AM NOT PAYING AN EXTRA $5 PER MONTH TO FIX DIRECTVNOW'S PROBLEM

Here's what I found using an AppleTV 4K:

**PRICE:**

It's a lot cheaper if you need regional sports (MLB for me). It has the big local channels. 

Add-on packages are generally cheaper too. 

**AUDIO/VIDEO QUALITY:**

Channels have 5.1 surround sound. DirecTV NOW had mid-quality stereo and that was frustrating. 

Image quality is all-around better for all channels. 

4K HDR TV is included in the cheapest plan! It's mostly sports and not many games, but still cool to see.  

**USABILITY:**  

Much faster loading, logical, and useful applications on iOS and AppleTV. 

You can just select shows like you would on the AppleTV ""TV"" app and you won't get dead end screens like you often did on DirecTV Now. 

DVR is better too! For sports at least, you can watch the entirety of games that have already aired even if you forgot to record them. 

You can use FuboTV on all devices that DirecTV NOW works on, including through your web browser. 

**CONCLUSION:**

I can't believe I didn't know this service existed. I had fun, DirecTV NOW, but it just wasn't meant to be. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/b6e4zc/ive_been_using_directv_now_since_it_came_out/,positive,0.9831

However my biggest issue is their apps. I love the Android Eco system and it drives me INSANE that there is still no AndroidTV app. Especially when theres a regular DirecTV AndroidTV app.

It seems clear to me after watching their Android TV box beta review, that AT&T has no intention of making a Android TV app that works outside of their Android box. I think they want to force people to pay for the box so they can profit off that. That is pure corporate greed if they do that. For people who already have Android TV it's a stab in their back. Also to make it worse the Android box won't have the traditional Android TV launcher and settings of it's released the way the beta is.

If YouTube TV, or Sling, or Playstation Vue, or anyone comes out with all my main channels I want before DirecTV comes out with an AndroidTV app, then I will switching to which ever provider that is.

Oh. My. God. It is so terrible. It takes over a minute to load the app, and then another 30 seconds of buffering a channel before it plays. The guide takes another minute to load, and if I navigate through the guide too quickly it will crash my whole TV. Really terrible experience. The other apps on Roku are definitely slow to launch compared to my ATV 4k, but they are all still usable. I'd categorize the DTVN now as unusable.

Are all Rokus like this?

From clicking on the DTVN app on ATV4 to actually having something on the screen is less than a second.

17,2018-07-10 06:52:51,AngryRooster223,A farewell to DTVN...,"TLDR - DTVN, get your crap together.  We are happier paying MORE for 2 different services than putting up with your bad service.

We've only been with DTVN for just over a month.  Beforehand we had normal DTV.  We were sick of the fees, BS, and horrible hardware.  We were customers for 10 years, no longer.

I signed us up for the $10 for 3 month DTVN promo.  A week into it we added Hulu Live as a comparison.  We didn't really care for the lack of a real guide and the wonky interface.  Hulu got downgraded before the 7 day trial was up.

Since our sign up with DTVN I've contacted support via chat only twice.  I could have contacted them over a dozen times with various problems.  The first time the problem wasn't fixed, but I was given a $10 credit (was never applied or seen in my account).  The second time was today.  That problem wasn't taken care of either, had to be escalated.  No mention of a credit, just a ""sorry you are having this issue"" after a full hour of chat.

The wife said she liked Hulu Live better even though there is no Roku guide and the interface is disorderly.  She's fed up with the DTVN problems as well, even though she only watches a couple hours a day.  We signed up for it again, it's less frustrating and has many benefits over DTVN.

We also signed up for Philo.  It gives us the remaining channels we were missing with Hulu.  Between these 2 services we have every channel we watched on DTV before we suspended our account until December.  We can record our shows and they actually show up in the list.  They are the proper shows as well, not something random like DTVN has done a couple of times.  We can actually pause shows as well, oh yeah, we can start them from the beginning as well.  Hmmm, what a concept...

Take note DTVN (and anyone else that is considering service from them).  We are paying MORE for these 2 services than we were for yours.  We have the inconvenience of having to maintain 2 bills and 2 different lists of channels, both of them without a proper traditional guide (using TitanTV for a guide), AND WE ARE HAPPIER THAN WE WERE USING YOUR SERVICE.  We will not even be finishing out the remaining 2 months at $10 each, it's just not worth it.

I don’t watch a ton of TV, but when I do DTVN seems to work fairly well on either the fire stick or AppleTV 4K. The mobile app also works well and it’s Zero rated so that is also pretty cool.

I do find that I use my DTVN login for more of the native provider apps (I.e. History Channel app, ABC app, etc...) to watch on demand content. 

For $20/month with HBO, I’d say the experience has been pretty good. After being a TiVo subscriber since the series two days, the big thing I miss is being able to fast forward past commercials.

How do I cancel when I don't know my Log-in info?,"EDIT: /u/bochez gave me a link to customer service that connected me without having to log in. I was able to talk with customer service and it looks like I finally have my issue resolved (I'll wait until next billing cycle to confirm this). I can't thank them enough for the link. I appreciate all the help and suggestions that everyone gave in the thread!

__________________________________________________________________________________________

An AT&T employee (let's call him 'B')  signed me up for DirecTV Now without my knowing or consent. When I noticed that I was being billed for a service I did not sign up for or used I went into the the AT&T store to get it fixed. The employees there tried to fix it, however in order to do so they needed the account/log-in information (email and password). Since B was the one who created the account, he is the only one who knows the log-in information. However B was fired from AT&T and no longer works there so there was no way for us to get this log-in information.

I tried calling the DirecTV Now customer service phone line, which just says to ""address any issues via their website"" and then hangs up. On the DirecTV Now website in order to reach customer service they require you to log in (again, I am unable to do this since I do not know my account information).

So with no other options I went to my bank (Bank of America) to dispute these transactions. After I explained my issue, they quickly refunded me the money, cancelled my credit card, and sent me a new card. However the DirecTV Now charges have still been showing up every month. I have called and gotten a new Credit card 5 times this year now, but I am still being charged every month on the 3rd. Every time I call BoA, the person on the line says something along the lines of how ""it can take a few cards for it to eventually stop charging"". But every time I get a new card, the DirecTV Now charge shows up again every month on the 3rd.

I am at my wits end. This has been an incredibly frustrating experience that won't seem to end. If anyone knows any way I could get this charge to stop showing up, or someone knows how I could cancel this membership it would be greatly appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/94t9gc/att_employee_signed_me_up_without_my_consent_how/,negative,-0.9012

Channel changing and guide browsing always felt sluggish to me, so I decided to finally try out the FireTV Pendant.

Channels change about 50% faster, but they're not instant like many Apple TV users say they are, as it still takes about 2-3 seconds for the channel to load.  

Browsing the guide is much smoother. Whereas the Firestick it would basically scroll through 5 or so channels, then pause to catch up (while also causing stuttering to the video itself) the FireTV is smooth as butter scrolling through the channels, and doesn't cause any kind of stuttering to the channel it is already on. 

Also, and this may be an issue only on my end, but my Firestick would never reliably transmit a Dolby Digital + signal, however this FireTV Pendant has no issue sending a DD+ signal to my receiver.

So in essence, for anyone in the market for a new streaming device, I'd recommend staying away from the Firestick, and getting the FireTV instead. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/9iv8wa/just_switched_from_firestick_2nd_gen_to_firetv/,negative,-0.8387

* Time-remaining indicator sometimes shows double (sometimes 3x or 4x) the actual length of the show. A couple of times a 1 hour show displays 11 hours remaining. This makes it hard to skip to a specific location in the recording.
* Video quality if terrible. The same show on it's equivalent/native streaming app has much better video quality.

I switched to DirectTVNow because I was fed up with my terrible cable provider. Starting to regret my choice. Since I pre-paid for 4 months (to get the free AppleTV deal), I'll give it some more time. But if it still sucks after, I might have to try a different service.

I am able to get a full guide, get info on said programs, and even get a dedicated ""back"" button. As a result, I LOVE the beta box now! For those who didn't get the new beta box with the updated remote, just get a Logitech remote and it'll be just as good (better in my opinion.)

This is what you'd type into the Harmony software to be able to access the beta box on your Harmony remote:

I cancelled it a few days prior to the end of the 3-month period.  I have an email from them that confirmed the subscription was cancelled and service would end on July 18, 2018.  

However, as of today(September 19), I can still watch every channel on DirecTVNow on my AppleTV 4k, as well as my Samsung Galaxy 9+ phone, iPhone 8, and also my iPad.   

I'm not being charged... when I originally signed up, I used a prepaid Visa gift card to pay for the 3 months.  That card currently has a balance of less than 50 cents.   There's also no record of DirectTVNow attempting to charge the card since July 18.  

Not that I""m complaining about free TV or anything, but I'm just worried that they will bill me for anything after July 18... they do have my address, since that's how they shipped the free AppleTV 4k at the beginning....  or am I just worrying about nothing?

This has actually happened to me before, when I first signed up for HBO GO. I assumed it would be fixed by itself this time. After 5 days I gave up and contacted DirecTV Now support.

According to tech support, the problem has been fixed internally but, like the last time I had this issue, \_something\_ has to be changed in your DirecTV Now account to trigger the update or refresh on your account so that the changes will make it through the system.

Part of the problem for me is that I signed up for DirecTV Now with my email address as my user id, which causes issues due to it being an email and/or the same email I use for my at&t account.  So support always tries to get me to change my user id to something really awesome like ""sirshannon123"" but I decline. The fix is as simple: Changing my password. The change apparently causes the account changes to propagate and everything works again.

&#x200B;

**What I don't know:** I don't know if I could have fixed the issue by changing my password (via forgot password link) without contacting support.  I guess I'll try that next time.

Anyway, try changing your DirecTV password (not your at&t password \[single sign-in form but no single sign-in, awesome\]) at [directvnow.com](https://directvnow.com) and if that doesn't fix the issue, it's gonna hurt but contact DirecTV Now customer support (I used the chat box on their site) and they'll be able to fix it for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/a68gid/how_i_fixed_my_hbo_go_directv_now_problem/,positive,0.9392

Since the teams negotiate their own broadcast rights for preseason games, most do NOT allow streaming over the various services like DTVN, Vue, etc.  This is on a station-by-station basis.

This DOES NOT have anything to do with regular season streaming rights as those are negotiated with the NFL and allowed on the services that have rights to ESPN, NFLN, FOX, and CBS.

As for local channels, DTVN provides most of them. For the ones it doesn't (like all the ""dot"" channels and PBS), I bought the WatchAir smart antenna. It gets great reception and enables me to record the OTA shows. Since it uses either an SD card or USB memory stick (I use a 128 GB memory stick with it), it's easy to transfer the recordings to a hard drive and keep them for as long as I like. It records in the industry standard "".TS"" format. That's easy to convert to MP4 for better compression.

I haven't considered any other service because DTVN is the only one that has all the channels my family wants. Given its low price, I'm really very happy with it.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/8l0tjf/happy_with_dtvn/,positive,0.9849

TL;DR - Called DTVN with my monthly complaint that they aren't broadcasting Buffalo Sabres games on MSG in Western NY. Got a promise that someone would call me back within 30 minutes. THEY DID. Explained the programming problem with MSG. Maybe we'll get some action now. (Maybe not.)

\----------------

First, a little background. Ever since DTVN started carrying MSG Network, they have had the wrong programming here in Western NY. We are supposed to get all of the Buffalo Sabres games, while Islanders/Devils/Rangers games are (I believe) supposed to be blacked out. Instead, we get zero Sabres games, and sometimes we get the other teams, sometimes we don't. I've contacted both DTVN and MSG about this in the past. DTVN gives a different answer every time. MSG claims that they have talked to DTVN about it, and the problem is on the DTVN side. Nothing they can do.

Fast forward to tonight.

I start my monthly-ish chat session with DTVN support. As normal, I start out playing stupid about not getting the games broadcast. Then they start the whole troubleshooting thing. Then I explain how its a problem with all of my devices, and how its a problem for all DTVN subscribers in Western NY. We eventually get to ""Its a known problem, we are working on it"". But instead of letting it go, I decide to push the guy a little bit. Firm, without being rude or threatening.

I ask him ""Whats your favorite team, Mike?"" (Yeah, ""Mike"".. haha). He tells me the Chicago Bears. I dunno. Maybe they show Bears games in India. So I say, ""Mike, would you keep subscribing to a service that promises to show Chicago Bears games every week, but can't deliver on that promise?"" and he says he gets what I am saying, and that he will escalate to his supervisor. I've heard that one before.. about 1/2 of my conversations are supposedly escalated. So I ask him ""Is there any way that I can follow up in a week or two to see where this stands?"", and he says he will have his supervisor call me, within 15-30 minutes. I chuckle to myself, because I've heard this one before too... just once... and of course, nobody ever called me that time. Before I disconnect with Mike, I say, ""Mike, I hope you aren't lieing to me about all of this"". He assures me that someone will call me back.

Well, damn if I didn't get a call back about a half hour later from ""Shawn"" at DirecTV Now (and yes, he also sounded more Indian than Irish... but he was pretty easy to talk to. My first reaction was that ""Mike"" probably had the guy sitting next to him call me and pretend to be his supervisor... but this guy seemed genuinely interested in helping. He let me explain the problem, and asked a few basic questions. I'm not sure that he understood the problem 100%, but he got the general gist of it. He was blaming MSG, but assured me that he would escalate it with the engineering staff at DTVN, and try to get them to work with the right folks at MSG to try and get the problem resolved.  The conversation ended with me thanking him greatly for calling me back and trying to understand and resolve the problem.

I'm still shocked that I was able to talk to someone at DTVN. My jaw hit the floor when the phone rang. I think I have achieved the impossible. Will they fix the problem now? I have no idea. But at least I talked to someone who attempted to understand what was happening, and who (theoretically) has the power to ""really"" escalate and maybe get the right people involved.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/a5e39u/achieving_the_impossible_i_spoke_to_a_directvnow/,positive,0.7709

I use a small tv on my desk while working and I find the in-menu previews make it almost impossible to continually read things as I scroll through... it's like the jump caused by this huge preview in the middle keeps popping up, ruin my ability to track the words as they scroll, and basically forces me to pause at each entry when previously I could scan the shows while they scrolled.  


for me it made it such a hard process that I just now go to the apps in apple tv for each channel, or the main ""tv"" app, and just see all the shows that way instead.

&#x200B;

It happened so subtly that I didn't quite realize it until I went back into the app today for the first time in over a month and realized how jarring it felt to me trying to scroll through the guide with the preview continually causing the words to jump.

&#x200B;

I wish the preview was just off to the side, so I'd have more menu entries to scroll through for easier reading, and then the preview could just be there doing it's thing if I actually wanted it.

- How is the DVR capability? Is it possible to record your shows?

- I heard a lot of cons but I haven’t heard positive things other than it has more channels compared to the other streaming services.

- Do they have hidden fees or increase at some point? I hope not.

The one in the living room stopped working. Wouldn't stream any channels or DVR recordings. Other apps on the Fire TV worked fine (Amazon Prime, Netflix). The Fire TV in the bedroom worked fine with DTVN. DTVN worked fine on my laptop and phone.

Things I tried:

* Rebooting the cable modem
* Rebooting the router
* Rebooting the Fire TV
* Clearing the data on the DTVN app
* Uninstalling and reinstalling the DTVN app
* Switching the Fire TV to the 2.8 GHz WiFi access point instead of the 5 GHz access point I usually used
* Switching the Fire TV to my mobile phone's WiFi tethering
* Chatting with DirecTV Now support, who had me clear the app's data and reboot again 

None of these fixed the problem, though the DTVN support guy did give me a $10 a month credit for the next three months. He said their network guys would look at it and see if it was a problem on their end. Narrator: It wasn't.

Anyway, the thing that worked was the first thing I should have tried... physically pulling the power plug out of the Fire TV box and plugging it back in after a 15-count.

My setup consists of the 4K LG OLED TV, and a Dolby ATMOS capable soundbar. 

I have no way (yet) of determining the exact bitrate and the resolution of the DTVN stream encoded by the DTVN box, but assuming it's exactly the same as the one served to the tvOS, then the DTVN box is equipped with below average processing and upscaling capabilities. The DTVN box forces all the content to 4K HDR at all times, and with equal picture settings on my TV set I am seeing less macro blocking, higher contrast and sharpness and lower Gamma on AppleTV 4K. The DTVN Box on the other hand makes the DTVN stream look average imho, as it seems to apply some additional noise reduction filter which makes the picture look softer and adds the dreaded watercolor effect.

Interestingly enough, the audio on the DTVN box seems to be going through some extra processing with slightly muted highs, again when compared to the AppleTV 4K connected to the exact same setup.

I understand that this is all my personal anecdotal experience, and also BETA, but I'd be curious to hear what others with the similar setup are experiencing.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/a6c9wh/dtvn_box_vs_appletv_4k_picture_and_audio_quality/,neutral,0.0234

*  the fast-forward/rewind functionality was AWFUL.  I couldn't get more accurate than within ""a few minutes"" when trying to jump to a point in the broadcast

*  there's no way to tell the app to record more time on that channel, so with the rain delay I guess you are SOL?  you have to record the NEXT two shows or something?  That would be like 30% of the could DVR space

Spectrum TV App provides a fully interactive and  seamless viewing experience, allowing customers to browse shows and  movies by category or network, aggregate a “Watch List” of favorite  content, set parental controls and much more.

I had been a DTVN customer for 10 months and had become used to dealing with constant problems. Buffering, dropped DVR recordings, app crashes, dropped channels, problems accessing On Demand programs, etc. If I went an entire day without any problems I felt elated. That only happened occasionally.

Then I noticed that FuboTV had a free 7-day trial and had virtually every channel I regularly watched. I decided to go ahead and give it a try. I was amazed. It just worked all-day, every day. No buffering or no other weird problems. I switched over to it and cancelled DTVN after the trial period expired.

Now, don't get me wrong, other than being solidly reliable it does have some issues. First of all, in spite of its beginnings as a sports oriented service, it doesn't have ESPN. That's one channel I will miss. Also, the user interface, especially for Roku devices, is a little clunky. The FireTV interface is better. I can't speak for the Apple TV interface.

Advantages - it has that pesky Hallmark Movies and Mysteries channel, the one that you lose from DTVN when you upgrade from the lowest level service. DVR recordings are very easy to set up, always work, and the minimum service allows 30 hours of recordings. In my local market, it supports the local CBS station, while DTVN didn't. On Demand program availability is extensive and works solidly. Any program you only partially watch is remembered and automatically kept for future viewing to completion.

If you are becoming frustrated with DTVN I suggest you give FuboTV a try for a service that just works.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/91fy4r/switched_to_fubotv_it_just_works/,negative,-0.7993

9,2018-05-24 16:26:54,rick607,Cord cutting and expectations,"Two months ago I had had enough of the cable company rate increases, poor picture quality and bundle BS. I decided to try streaming instead. 

My first trial was Sling Orange and Blue and it was not for me. I didn't care for the interface or the channel selection. I tried it basically just to see if I would like it. I had the same feeling about Playstation Vue as well. For me, it was just meh...

My next trial was Directv Now. I liked the interface because it resembled what I was used to in cable tv. No DVR was a drawback and virtually no frills had me wanting more.

Having not yet tried Hulu Live, I gave that a shot. My first impression was great, it was the only service that gave me locals, the interface was flashy and felt like it could be a cool new way of watching tv, That didn't last long... picture quality was lacking and the hassle of trying to watch tv ""the old way"" was annoying due to the way they implement live and on-demand content. Also, the fact that I had to supplement it with Philo was too convoluted. I should also add that my wife was not into this switch to streaming nearly as much as me and ""I hate this"" was becoming her mantra.

With nothing left to try since Youtubetv is not in my area yet, I went back to Directv now. It offers the most comprehensive channel selection (for me) and a basic and easy to use guide. Is it perfect? No, not even close, but the picture quality is there along with the content I want, and impending DVR, so I figured it was my best bet.

That is a recap of my experience so far, which brings me to my point in posting this. **Anyone looking to cut the cord and stream has many choices and I often see people asking which is the best service. There is no accurate to answer that question because there is no level playing field.** If you want cheap go with Sling. If you are after channel selection, I say Directv now. I thought Playstion Vue fell somewhere in the middle. Hulu has potential especially if you watch a lot of on-demand network shows. If you're looking to make the switch to streaming be sure to take advantage of every service that offers a free trial and decide for yourself before you cancel your cable service. There is a learning curve and with streaming services, and they don't offer same experience you are used to with cable, so be ready to experiment.

9,2018-05-20 16:33:48,AvailableClassic,How has DVR changed your outlook on DTVN?,"DVR has been out for a week so curious to hear if it’s changed anyone’s view of DTVN, either for the better or worse.  I’ve been in the beta so not much surprises me.  The DVR is pretty solid, albeit with few bells and whistles.  I’m disappointed that several obvious bugs still exist.  Series recordings still don’t work for some shows and I’m dumbfounded that they didn’t provide a way to lock-in the “favorites” listing on the program guide.  Oh, and I have to log into DTVN on one of my devices almost every day.  REALLY annoying.  

DTVN still has zero of my local stations.  Even if they add 1 or 2, all 4 seems very unlikely.  

Right now I’m paying $35 for DTVN $8 per month for the Channels DVR to record local stations.  Should I decide to add the third stream ($5) and extra DVR space ($10), that takes me up to $58.  

Honestly I’m considering switching to Youtube + Philo.  That would be $56 total for 3 streams (really more if some are watching YTTV and others Philo), unlimited DVR and all 4 of my local stations.  The YTTV interface is superior.  The individual user accounts are a very nice feature for a family of 4.  YTTV has Xbox One support (we own two consoles.)  The only real negative I see is the commercial situation on YTTV DVR.  But I actually find myself not fast-forwarding about half the time on these cloud DVRs because it’s just so clunky.  

This wasn’t meant to be a “bye-bye, I’m leaving” post.  Still not sure what I’ll do.  Just curious to hear where others stand after a few days with the long-awaited DVR and new interface.

When I watch a DVR'd show, I used to be able to tap the right of the remote to FF 15 sec. Now when I do that now it either just stops the show or makes it jump like 10 minutes.

The only way I can FF or Rewind is by pausing and ball parking it by moving the curser forward or back without actually seeing where I'm at. 

This is new - It didn't react this way even yesterday. Very frustrating. I checked my remote in Netflix and the clicking works for the 10 sec FF and Rewind.

I'm hesitant to complain, because it's just about watching TV...but I'm about 4 months into having DirecTVNow on my Roku Ultra.  When I start the app on Roku, the guide comes up with ALL available channels in alphabetical order.  Not my favorites, and not the last channel I was watching.  When I'm watching something and bring up the guide, it comes up NOT on the channel I'm watching, but with the first channel in alphabetical order.  I spend a lot of time scrolling and clicking.

I do have an SD card in my Roku.  Not sure 'why', since it doesn't appear to store anything.

I wish I had more control over my defaults, and that Roku would remember my settings.  It does remember which channels are favorites, but I have to ask for my Favorites List every time I turn it on.

I know these are little complaints, because the channels all look and sound great and I finally have the DVR figured out.  But the issues with the guide make me a little nuts.

7,2018-10-04 20:10:33,eXistenceLies,Week 1 of DTVN....,"Things I have noticed with streaming this service on Roku/Amazon/Android....

&#x200B;

**CONS...**

DVR's playback sound is noticeably quieter than live TV.

Watching recorded shows/movies it freezes quite often at like half second intervals. I want to say it happens on live TV too.

Watching recorded shows/movies it will sometimes starts to buffer then starts back from beginning of show.

No way to change the 15 second skip forward. Should be an option that I hope to come soon.

Noticeably slower on Roku device.

Interface def needs a buff to make things snappy. If they could make it as snappy as ROKU's interface it would be fantastic. Amazon's interface is kinda clunky. Never used Apple TV nor no plans to.

DVR is in Beta mode (not really a con per-say, but for some people this will turn them off). It'll improve a lot by next year I bet.

&#x200B;

**PROS...**

Cheap monthly bill compare to Comcast (previous cable provider).

Don't have to use their internet service to use their streaming service like Comcast.

Can change your subscriptions monthly. Perfect for when you only want to watch one show per year that comes out on HBO/Showtime/etc. Of course there are other ways to view those show for free, but I won't mention that.

3 streams as of now isn't bad, but would like to see more in the future.

Same goes with more DVR space.

Not sure how many recordings you can record at once, but coming from Comcast it was 5 shows. (Someone correct me here).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I think that is it for now. The cons aren't going to scare me away either. I have all the channels I need and I am not paying $100+ for HD TV plus $30 in DVR boxes + HD boxes. Good thing is my internet provider (Entouch) does not have a data cap on their fiber package. Now I can stream as much as I want in the best quality. Just wanted to share my experiences after 1 week.

7,2018-08-03 21:18:11,robertpetry,I'm struggling to figure out how to watch local NFL on CBS,"Hello all. Hopefully you will have a solution for me.  

I currently have the promo ""go big"" plan that is only $40 per month and is no longer offered.  This is great as I have a bunch of channels and the best streaming package per buck in the market.  I don't want to give it up.  

But I need to be able to watch my local CBS (Indy) to see Colts games each week.  I would like to be able to steam anywhere, play on my TV, pause and rewind, and record for later.  Sounds great BUT my local CBS is not on DirecTVNow.  But it is on Hulu TV and YoutubeTV.  I would have to drop the DTVNow if I picked one of the other two to get my local CBS. 

I have looked at other options:

1. Use antenna - would be fine for live games but no recording (without buying another box and setting that up), no streaming outside of home, no live pauses (without box).  So pretty restrictive.
2. I could use my local CBS app that has view live TV - but the quality is total crap.  Streaming it to the TV with Airplay is horrible.  It just does not work well enough for me. 
3. Subscribe to CBS All Access - but live NFL games are excluded from the subscription
4. Subscribe to NFL Sunday Ticket, but local games are excluded live - only out of market are live.  

So I guess I am at a crossroads.  Give up DTVNow and my great package/promo price or miss football each week.

DirecTV Now is a good service but l think it’s not ready for a national roll out. The basic package lineup and price plus the cheap premiums is an awesome deal. I will miss A&E and Viacom networks again but I think I will be okay with Vue Core package going forward. I never understood why we all have the east coast feeds. I live in AZ and if I want to watch WWE Live they will start at 5pm Lmao. DVR is a bit buggy for now.

Original post: OWN (Oprah Winfrey Network) app login with your DirecTV Now login. You'll have to choose ""Manifest Communications"" to log in on your devices -- tested this on both Android and iOS 13 beta 2 and it works. If you're on iOS, single sign-on may work.

Hopefully, AT&T will allow DTVN users to log in to Warner properties, like CNN, TBS, and TNT, in the future.

Update: It looks like OWN removed the ability to log in with Manifest. I tried last night on my iPhone and Fire Stick 4K and it worked. This morning I tried on my ATV and Manifest was not an option.

* after that, my bill will continue at $55+$5.

1. Are there any issues to watch out for, or workarounds I need to be aware of?
2. When fast forwarding through recorded shows, the commercials on the satellite version shows progress but the DTV Now version shows a static image with the time progressing?
3. I'm using the FireTV Cube which seems fast and smooth, but looks like it has more functionality with the satellite hardware than the DTV Now app. For example, if I tell it to switch to Comedy Central instead of changing channels on DTV Now it switches inputs to satellite and goes to that channel.
4. On my Epson 3700 projector with a 106"" screen the picture on DTV Now seems as good as satellite with the hour or two I watched last night. I haven't tried it on my 4K Samsung TV.

I want to say if I had to complete a command on scrolling through the options and searching for a movie the Roku would win by at least 5 seconds. Amazon FireTV is laggy most of the time. Maybe it is because of the Logitech Harmony remote I use, but I use this remote for both Roku and FireTV.

7,2018-09-13 15:43:16,Devildog820,HBOGo Not Activating (Something Went Wrong) Solution and Possible Explanation,"I had this issue when activating HBOGo. No matter what I did it wouldn't work and I couldn't get anything other than ""Something went wrong"" as a response. After solving my issue, I have a theory. Check the TL;DR at the bottom if you just want to fix the problem.

Here is my guess. AT&T is consolidating their various services together. Anyone who does this for a living on the server side knows what a nightmare it is to accomplish. When AT&T integrated DirecTV NOW, they screwed up the authentication chain. Your DirecTV NOW password is ""good"", but it doesn't match your main AT&T password. I would suspect AT&T authenticates DirecTV NOW, then uses the same secure password hash to authenticate into their main system and it fails. That's why if you put in a wrong DirecTV NOW password, you get a different error message.

    Your password -> converted to secure hash -> authentication success at DirecTV NOW -> forward secure hash to AT&T account -> failure

I noticed that after trying it a lot in a short period of time. My DirecTV NOW account got locked out for invalid password attempts even though I was cutting and pasting it. I confirmed I was able to use the cut/paste to log in to the DirecTV NOW website.

I reset my password at DirecTV NOW and noticed it said my password would change for all AT&T services. Sure enough, I tried to log in to my main AT&T account with my AT&T password and got a bad password error. I used the DirecTV NOW password and got right in. So, reset your AT&T password using the DirecTV NOW site (just to be sure they properly propagate it through the system). After that, you should be able to use your new password to successfully authenticate HBOGo.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR - Change / Reset your password on the** [**directvnow.com**](https://directvnow.com) **site. It will change your main** [**att.com**](https://att.com) **password too, but it will fix the ""Something went wrong"" error you are getting. Also, ensure you log in to the DirecTV NOW website with a browser to finish setting up your account (create security questions, etc.).**

&#x200B;

**edit: My passwords are the same on DirecTV NOW and AT&T. I also merged all my accounts within AT&T, using the consolidator on their website. That could have affected things too.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/9fj37h/hbogo_not_activating_something_went_wrong/,negative,-0.8316

Luckily, I have an antenna to watch OTA broadcasts when DTVN is not available.

However, I have a hard time recommending DTVN to friends and family as a solution for cord cutting. The system has been so unreliable the last month, similar to the problems I had in 2016 and early 2017. I'm willing to stick with it in the hopes that DTVN will improve over the next 6 months, but for now I can't recommend DTVN to others since the whole platform still feels like a beta product, not just the DVR but the entire service.

I have a few general questions, as I have not had this box / remote myself. Does the remote use Bluetooth to connect to the box, and can you connect it to other devices (for example, would it work or pair with an Nvidia Shield)? Does the remote have any IR capability, or does it work with CEC?

&#x200B;

**Notes**:

* I currently pay $25 for the $40 ""Live a Little"" package because of the AT&T discount. I usually bump this up to the ""Just Right"" package in the fall to get more sports networks and then I pay $35 for the $50 package.
* If the increase is $10 I would be paying $35 and $45 during the year which is pretty comparable to YTTV at $40 and YTTV already includes the sports channels (ESPNU, SEC Network, etc.) that I have to upgrade my DTVN package to get every fall. How comparable they are overall really depends on which channels you watch.
* I only get Fox as a local channel on DTVN. I get ALL locals including The CW on YTTV.
* I get HBO for free because of AT&T.

I sometimes have this with Netflix or WWE Network but after a few seconds it becomes crystal clear. However, I have let it play for upwards of 30 minutes and it is still in terrible quality. Even items such as HBO are showing in this terrible quality.

6,2018-11-28 13:06:46,ganoveces,Just signed up and have issues on all devices!,"Last night i wanted to test directv now at home on numerous devices (windows 10 pc, samsung smart tv w/ DTVN beta app pre-installed and android app.   

I decided to test $65 package and get a free roku stick if I pay for a month up front.   

I had issues logging in due to lastpass pulling my old ATTid so i had to chat to get all that resolved.   Got it figured out and logged in using chrome. 

Well, chrome in a regular window would not load video on my PC and I had to use incognito.  This seems fishy from the get go. 

Next i wanted to try the DTVN app on my Samsung Smart TV.   It came pre-installed with DTVN Beta App and it would not work at all.   Got logged in and it threw error ""something is wrong, try again later"" and the only option is close it, re-open, log in again and get same error.   Now im getting annoyed.   

Also having an issue on android phone saying it cant find location even though the app has location service perms and i have tried all 3 location modes. 


I chatted with support this morning and they suggest I 'reboot your modem/router' (typically IT line) and they 'refreshed my account'.   Support said it should work on samsung but still in beta so expect bugs and still no date to roll out a stable build.

Ill try 'turning the internet off/on again' tonight and see what happens. 

On top of that, seeing that i added the free roku stick and paid up front they will not give me a refund.  I my haste I overlooked the fine print.  They did drop my bill $5 for 2 months for my issues but i would have thought they had this tech figured out by now.   

Not happy thus far.   

Anyone else having these issues?

edit:  last night had same error (hmm something went wrong, try again later) on dtvn app on fire tv 4k ultra device.   Still only worked on chrome incognito and i had close and reopen chrome a couple times before video would load.   chatted (4th time in under 24hrs) with support to see if it was something on my router that could be changed and got not answers.   was told my case has be elevated to technical team and have now been given a total of $15 off my next 2 billing cycles, which holds no water as i will be cancelling and testing PlayStation Vue.

6,2018-08-02 03:56:20,splsplinter24,Don’t make the same mistake I did when trying to cancel,"2 weeks ago, I decided to cancel my DirecTVNow service. No major reason, just several minor ones (lagging, poor on-demand selection, several poor customer service interactions). I decided to cancel right at the end of a billing cycle and before I went out of town for 2 weeks. I clicked cancel on the manage account section and was taken to a second screen that looked like a confirmation screen, with an option to return to manage account. I clicked that and figured that was the end of it. 

I come back from vacation and noticed my CC had been charged for the next billing cycle. I log back and go through the cancellation process again - this time I notice that after clicking the cancel button on the manage account screen the next screen which I assumed was a confirmation screen there is another much  smaller text hyperlink below that says click here to officially cancel. The text is small so it’s easy to miss.

Now, I understand that this is definitely my own fault - I should have been more careful and noticed that I had to click through again and should have noticed the lack of confirmation email. But the layout of these screens is definitely deceiving, and I can see people making the same mistake.

Unfortunately I can’t send a screenshot after officially cancelling, but bottom line if you plan on canceling be sure to read everything carefully.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/93vzgg/dont_make_the_same_mistake_i_did_when_trying_to/,negative,-0.8937

Some of these channels are blacked out as I’m not located in that market. I’ve chatted with DTVN frequently regarding the issue and have received wildly different responses. The most typical response is that my IP address is to blame. While being a dynamic ip, it hasn’t changed since the update. It’s geolocation using most third party services is in my city. DTVN recommends contacting my isp to request an ip with geolocation in my city. My dynamic ip that could put me in another city at any moment, per DTVN sources. Their guaranteed fix is a static ip at this point. 

All that being said, this is occurring at the same time as a google geolocation api price increase. Coincidence? Perhaps. 

What’s frustrating is that the geolocation issues began with the beta. DTVN was aware but chose to release it. And once the update is loaded, location is a toss up. 

Here are the questions I can’t seem to find an answer for. Why didn’t DTVN correct the problem in beta? Did DTVN previously use billing zip or google geolocation api or...? Why can’t they make the previous app available for for those experiencing geolocation issues? It’s already been a solid month, how much more patience do DTVN customers need to have?

I noticed that most channels are now Dolby Digital, so I got really excited as it was one of several factors holding me back from switching from DTV satellite.

&#x200B;

Reading [Cord Cutter News's](https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/directv-now-expands-5-1-audio-to-more-channels/) coverage, the article says "" According to reports DIRECTV NOW now offers 5.1 audio on all channels that support Dolby Digital Audio or DTS"" and "" Only programs that are recorded in Dolby Digital Audio will offer Dolby Digital Audio.""

I noticed that NBC Sports Net (and the RSNs) were stereo.  Fair enough as Hockey isn't surround sound.  However, on satellite, the channel outputs DD to my receiver.   So my question is, does DirecTV satellite upmix stereo to DD 5.1 for output on that channel?    I wouldn't have any way of knowing.  Does this mean that content like this that is inherently stereo will come through the stereo?  Or is the audio broadcast in 5.1 and DTV Now is only supporting stereo on those channels?

This isn't a complaint or anything.  I'd rather the audio be delivered natively anyway.  If it's recorded in stereo, I'd rather it be delivered in stereo and vice versa.  I was just wondering if anyone had a more technical explanation of what content is DD, which is not, and why.

I was legitimately excited to see live streams come through in DD, LOL. When my promo with DTV Satellite is up I might try to make the switch (again.)  I tried last year but DVR wasn't there, streams were failing a lot, and I got a win back deal that was pretty insane.

4,2019-02-04 21:07:10,alfasf,Directv now data cap on Roku," 

Hello community, 

After research in different forums, I still have failed to find an alternative solution to my bandwidth situation as we are on data cap (1TB) from Xfinity. We have changed our viewing habits to watching TV on one tv if necessary for example. We became cord cutters meaning we cut tv service so we rely on broadband Internet.

Right into our decision of cutting the cord we signed up for Sling for a month, we found our data usage went up reasonably because of the streaming after adjusting the video quality on Sling, so pretty much we were averaging 1 - 1.5 Gb per hour (15-20 GB per day). However, we didn’t like Sling and subscribed to Directv Now, and our data consumption increase dramatically in just two days since we signed up (7GB - 10 GB per hour; 50-75GB per day!) so as you all may see we would exceed the data in less than 20 days!

This is our home setting:

ISP: Xfinity 

Plan: 60Mbps

Cable Modem: Technicolor CGM4140COM 

Streaming Devices: 2 Roku Premiere Plus

TV types: 2 1080p TVs

Location: SF Bay Area 

This is what I have tried so far:

1. Adjust Rokus to 720p from the Roku display menu. This is the lowest display type offered. I would like set it to lower for SD viewing
2. Adjustable override bit rate from secret menu: 5 Home, 3 back, 2 forward set to 0.3 Mbps. Looks like this doesn’t do much effect to Directv Now     
3. Directv Now support were not able to configure the bandwidth on my account. 
4. Purchased a Netgear AC1600: I had read in different forums and tech sites that a router would give me more control on set limits to streaming so it doesn’t consume so much data by using QoS features. However, I was disappointed to find out their QoS is not very friendly on how to use the feature. Calling Netgear tech support and their forums are empty on how to use this feature. 
5. Make sure closing the Roku app and set to Home before turning TV off. 
6. Wifi password is secured and not one else using it.
7. We also have Antenna TV but reception gets bad in bad weathers.
8. Besides of relying on streaming for entertainment, our household is very simple for Internet. One PC connected to Ethernet, 1 Ipad disable for apps to auto-update, 2 windows PC that manually updates. All of them do basic browsing, occasional music streaming (Pandora, Spotify, etc..), YouTube on browser or app. NO GAMING in household.   

Basically if someone recommends a good router that is pretty straightforward to set the two Rokus to certain downstream, and that  it shows the data consumption per device. I would like to set the streaming to a reasonably data streaming (1GB per hour or less).  

Anyone of you have suggestion on how to deal with this. Feel free to ask anything that may be useful useful or consider.

Hopefully this thread become a reference for those who are in a similar situation like me.

So If you can watch any show on demand after its original air date then why would you even need DVR unless this doesn't hold true for some shows and I just haven't noticed yet.

It seems DTV Now could just keep all previously aired shows and link to them in the app, that way there is only one copy of a show which would save server space.

I don't have STARZ currently, but plan to subscribe when American Gods comes back in a few months.  My wife wants to catch up on Outlander too.  Anyway, it looks like we can add Starz to DTVN for $8/month or  subscribe directly and use the Starz app for $8.99.  We could also add it to our Amazon Prime for $8.99 as well.  


I'm looking for opinions on the best way.  Doing it via DTVN saves a buck and gives me a few (how many?) live channels.  I'm on the lowest tier, so I think I might get 3 channels if I add Starz.  It looks like I cannot sign in to the STARZ app with DTVN credentials, so we are limited to using the DTVN app to watch content. How is this?  Does it work fine?  Any downside?  Do new episodes of things like American Gods hit on-demand on DTVN as soon as they do on the STARZ app?  


Doing it directly via STARZ means I have to give them my credit card.  I'm not sure if cancelling will be a hassle.  It costs 99 cents more and I do not think it has the live channels.  Any reason to go this route?  I know they are running a $5/mo for 3 months promo right now, but I don't really plan to subscribe until March.  


Any reason to go with adding STARZ to Prime Video?  Any advantage to this?

Sorry if this has been asked and addressed. I looked through and couldn't find anything.

5,2018-09-20 20:23:58,wdmccoll,High Data usage with DTVN,"  

The question is does DTVN use significantly more data than comparable streaming plans?

My internet connection is thru Comcast, with a 1,024GB “cap”. I’m fairly new to cordcutting, began with Sling and after 3 mos. switched to DVTN at the end of August, wooed by their introductory offer.

Now I am getting warnings from Comcast about my data usage. Not yet a full month but looking back historically, it seems my data use could almost double at my current September rate. 

I do not have a 4k tv, just one tv receiving HD at up to 1080. No daytime tv except weekends, mainly for sports.

Using Comcast’s Estimator with generous inputs, my usage figures out to an estimated 560GB per month which is exactly what I did in August with Sling. The month of July, with Sling only (streaming at highest quality), was 520GB. So, no big difference in total usage time, only change is the streaming provider with more channels, including local channels.

According to Comcast, 99% of customers don't come close to a terabyte per month. I should be able to stream between 600 and 700 hours of HD video and I am not even half of that. No way I am in the top 1%.

One gripe about DTVN is that everything is slow, there are wait times to load. Is this system loading just bad design that results in higher data usage? Even so, it could not be a 90% increase!",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/9hinjo/high_data_usage_with_dtvn/,negative,-0.9041

3,2018-08-31 15:35:06,GMahler_vrroom,Question about the Cloud DVR recordings...,"I've had DTVNow service for a little while (signed up to get the ""free"" ATV4K), but only just started messing with the Cloud DVR.  The very first recording I scheduled (the season finale of ""Preacher"" on AMC) turned out to be unwatchable - the recording had numerous skips/gaps embedded into it, resulting in sections of dialogue and action just missing entirely.  It didn't matter when I watched (I came back and tried it again multiple times), so I don't think it was a streaming issue.  Also, the gaps were exactly at the same moment in the recording every time.  (Thankfully I also recorded it on my TiVo that I haven't quite abandoned yet.)

So here's what I'm wondering: was that 'my' recording of ""Preacher""?  As in, a personal recording of the episode into the cloud that was made just for my account?  Or was that recording made by DTV from the live broadcast by AMC and then shared to multiple users (anyone else who also requested to record ""Preacher"") - and therefore lots of people were experiencing the same issues?

I'm wondering about this for two reasons: 1) does it do any good to ""re-record"" a badly recorded show - because if we all get the same 'shared' episode from the cloud, that bad recording would potentially just be waiting yet again; 2) if we are getting shared recordings, this might play into why they are not responding to requests for user-specific changes like episode padding (more time at the start or end of an episode), as what we see as ""our"" recordings are just copies from a shared pool.

Two days ago I chatted with a rep and asked about NFL RedZone coming to DTVN. He told me after some research and talking to his manager that negotiating for the channel are all but final and that it will be available for this upcoming season. He went as far to make a guarantee for this. 

Sounds a bit like BS, yes, and we’ve heard it before, but if coincides with NFL Network being added recently along with Season Ticket in a few markets. 

This channel is a deal breaker for me. I’m willing to give it until the Saturday before Week 1 before jumping ship.

* Click ""Menu"" to see the menu screen that includes ""Watch Now"", ""My Library"" and ""Discover""
* Navigate to ""Discover""
* Select ""Networks""
* Under ""All Networks"" select a normal channel like ""ABC"" or ""A&E"" (whatever you have available)
* Switch from ""Programs"" to ""On Now""
* You should see an abbreviated version of the guide that shows just this channel.
* Now when you go back to the regular ""Guide"", you should see all channels without a problem.

I have no idea why this worked but it's been a week and it hasn't gone away. I haven't tried restarting my Apple TV or anything to replicate the issue and confirm the solution - hoping I can keep it like this for awhile. ;)

It's possible this is related to the Apple TV update earlier this week (https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/8zma41/apple_tvonly_update_says_log_out_issue_is_fixed/), but I'm pretty sure I ""fixed"" this on my Apple TV prior to that update.

Yesterday I received a Roku update, and last night was able to finally watch shows on DVR again.

I  had some minor buffering within the shows, but overall I was able to get through a 2 hour show in just over an hour (skipping commercials).  After that, a 30 minute show I was able to FF past commercials with no issues.

Hopefully a good sign of things to come.

The other thing is that the 100 hour option is available behind the scenes.  I asked a support person to bump me up to 100 hours (with a credit to offset the cost) as a result of issues.

The cost is $5 a month (I received an automated email after the activation).

I don't know if everyone has this yet, the support person said they saw the option on my profile and was able to activate.

It started with this football season on ESPN. MNF was unwatchable because the picture just freezes after a few minutes while audio keeps going. Switching channels helps but that error keeps coming back. It also happens on other events like F1.
DVR is very flaky the last few weeks. Recordings have skips in them. I know it‘s still beta but was doing fine before.
Buffering issues: I don’t know how many times per evening I get: „your network seems to be underperforming...“. Example: tried to watch F1 this morning, after two minutes I had that message, video came back blurry. Happened another time two minutes later. Switched to the ESPN app: picture is perfectly sharp, no buffering issues the entire race. This is an ongoing problem on every program.
Support: the espn problem above was reported via chat and a fix was promised within two days, nothing happened. I‘m sick of doing the „reinstall app, reboot every device, check WiFi“ dance, which clearly doesn‘t help at all.
Black screen: often the running program just goes black within the first half our after switching on. Just happens once. Problem from the beginning. According to the changelog it should have been fixed.

While the package itself is a good deal, the app on Apple TV just blows. Sorry but I’m not shelling out money for a service which gets worse over time. Bye DTVN

I just couldn't see paying almost $70 a month for all those channels we don't use. Now to the complaints DirectTv Now  on Roku is horrible! It takes forever to load then once it finally does you have to wait for the guide to load. Next the constant buffering is enough to make a preacher swear! I hoped with every update that the app would get better and really it seemed to only get worse. How can a $20 television package work better than a $70 one? I'll never understand but somehow it does! Philo has all the channels we watch except for Disney and Cartoon Network for the kids but we can use Grandma's Spectrum info to watch those on the apps. And then there's the horrible DVR! I was a DirecTV Now customer for several months but I just couldn't see paying for a service so poor any longer. If AT&T doesn't start caring more I think they probably will continue to lose customers, especially if other cheaper services keep adding channels like Philo has been. I also have Hulu and Netflix and my antenna for locals so I'm not missing anything I care about. I doubt I will ever go back to DirecTV Now only because I used it for the entertainment channels but they have a lot of work to do if they want to compete with cheaper services.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/9rjg72/cancelled_my_go_big_package_yesterday_switched_to/,negative,-0.9584

3,2018-10-22 20:36:19,everydave42,Why I left DTVNow,"Not a rage or brag post, just informative for those that might have had the same issues I've had and what I've found in another round of research...

Equipment (since it can affect experience):

\- Apple TV 4k

\- Comcast ""up to"" 150mb (routinely tests via speediest and fast at 160+ from the ATV)

\- Orbi Mesh networking, ATV hardwired into Sat.

I stuck with DTVNow for 3+ months on their intro offer. I liked their channel line up and discounts on HBO and Showtime. Unfortunately I was never very happy with it because:

\- Picture quality in general was OK but never great. However, any live sports was bad. Lots of pixelation and stutters. I assume this had something to do with their own encoding process of that data as it came in from the event

\- DVR never worked: pausing live tv would last less than a minute, any longer of that and it would jump to live with no option to rewind. Trying to set up recording of shows never worked (always gave some error message)

\- Local channel nonsense: didn't have NBC for a while, as soon as we got that along with promotional email about it, we lost ABC silently

\- User interface is...just weird. Repeated ways to get to guide, but none of it intuitive. I know there's some limitations with how the ATV has the ""simple"" remote, but this is just crack-addled.

\- No Dolby 5.1 sound

\- Price Hike

\- Repeated service and billing issues: When calling in to ask what can be done about the above I would go through reboot and setting hoops, all would fail, would be told I would get credits. Credits wouldn't show up on account have to call back in to get those credits...twice, with one credit STILL not applied (combo of monthly and one time).

After spending too much time on chat and phone chasing credits I just decided it wasn't worth it even though I (supposedly) had outstanding credit on my account, I cancelled it.

I'm now on Hulu Live TV and so far it's the best of what I've tried (I had also tried Sling a bit ago). If you already have a Hulu account it's another $33 a month so a good deal (to me, anyway). It's got a 7 day trial so you can just do that if you want to see. Upsides:

\- Much better picture quality, including live events

\- DVR just works. Live pausing, show recording, etc..all as expected

\- User interface is much more intuitive. Still weird due to ATV remote limitations, but it's much more clear and concise, almost intuitive.

Downsides:

\- No Velocity/Discovery Network channels, but those are supposed to come in December..no idea of those come with a price change or not

\- No HBO/Showtime discount..but with the cheaper core cost of the service it's about a wash

\- No Dolby 5.1 sound.

So there you have it. I know different people have different experiences, based in large part on device they're using. But the perpetual non functional DVR ""beta"" state and the inability of customer support and billing to accomplish much of anything left me dissatisfied. Maybe HuluTV will turn out to be a bust as well, but so far it's promising, maybe I'll stick with them a bit..or maybe something like this will be posted in their sub in a few months...

2,2019-03-14 06:33:00,lexguru86,It isn't that bad. I'm just concerned about how long it will last.,"Even at DTVN's largest package, the fact that there are no box fees and no contracts is still a win for me. The recent survey shows that most people plan on keeping DTVN even with the price hikes.

&#x200B;

Let's look at the new prices:

&#x200B;

Live a Little ($50) -> Entertainment ($93)

Just Right ($65) -> Choice ($110)

Go Big ($75) -> Xtra ($124)

Gotta Have It ($85) -> Ultimate ($135)

Todo Y Mas ($55) -> Optimo Mas ($86)

&#x200B;

Live a Little: $43 increase (86%)

Just Right: $45 increase (69%)

Go Big: $49 increase (65%)

Gotta Have It: $50 increase (59%)

Todo Y Mas: $31 increase (56%)

&#x200B;

Thanks to /u/holow29 for the clear breakdown

&#x200B;

Ultimate at $135 with HBO and Showtime + 3 streams puts me at around $166 a month + tax.

&#x200B;

**I have never seen a single cable company that offers these channels at a price this low without a contract.**

&#x200B;

Not to mention the fact that we don't need to rent boxes? I have a TV in my living room, kitchen, garage, office, bedroom, guest bedroom, and even on buildings in my property that are detached from my main home.. If I want to add another one? Cool, I buy a FireTV or ATV and viola, I have cable in that room.

&#x200B;

So yeah, the price increase and new packages come as a shock to us. But the convenience of not having to call support for a new box installation, paying rent for multiple boxes, being able to just drop or downgrade packages without dealing with retention teams, is well worth even the $161 a month. Plus the channel lineup for most packages are pretty decent. Comcast will give me a thousand channels for $79 a month + $40 in fees. 90% of those channels will be music channels.

&#x200B;

I'm just hoping they keep all of the channels. After reading some responses, it actually makes sense to keep these channels as they plan on transitioning people from DTV to DTVN.

You get all your local channels and 10 premium cable channels of your choice. After taxes it is right around $25. I did a free trial and cancelled. They offer it to Internet only customers exclusively and it only supports the Roku box for real TV viewing. It is a sign of fear and weakness for them to capitulate in offering this option that we were told, over ten years ago, was not realistic. How things have changed! I am currently a DirecTV Now subscriber on the grandfathered $35/mo. plan. I recently tested YouTube TV. I’ll be cancelling it too and keeping DTVN. A future offering coming soon is AT&T Watch at $15/mo. It could be a huge game changer. No bloated sports packages, and according to a recent presentation by ATT execs, they will only pay the content providers if customers actually watch their channels! HELLO!!?? This is hopefully the future. Being forced to pay for any package that includes content you don’t want is downright un\-American IMO. ATT is on the right track with Watch. We’ve been bamboozled for too long with cable TV thinking. The future of TV is choice, not take it or leave it. If some channels disappear, good riddance.

Two, Vue increased their price a year ago up by $10 (for locals that I still wouldn't have in my area). Sling TV increased their price by $5 just last month. And YouTube TV increased their price by $5 a few months ago.

It's clear that all of these streaming TV packages are not making enough money, but they needed a low price to get customers. A price increase was inevitable. To be upset at a price increase is reasonable, I understand that. It's actually a big reason I switched from Vue Core to DTVN.

Nightmare time! (1) What I selected to record to my library (cloud  storage) was 90% unplayable, despite constant attempts to run  them. (2) The few recordings which did play back could not be       deleted - DTN literally returned them to my library with each attempt to delete! - thus sitting on 6 precious hours of the tiny 20  hours of allotted cloud storage. (3) Programs I slated to record would not accept a change of mind: I could not stop the weekly recording event So, every week I saw another 3 hours of my 20  hours of cloud storage add on without any ability to actually watch those programs.

I wrote the first of three long chat discussions with DTN's Customer Service Team: a phone number is not an option for DTN customers as folks would be yelling at the poor reps all day and night! But I wanted chat, as it would leave a written transcript behind. I am glad I kept them. A case number was assigned, all details noted, and promises made to have the issues resolved  within the week. What I could not know was that this was the routine response to any and all customer complaints: make       promises, keep the customer attached to the account, take their money.

It is my belief that selling 'vapor ware' (software or programming  that does not exist except in the mind of the designer) is not only reprehensible but entirely unethical and can never be justified. I ended my third chat session with the comment to the poor rep that they must feel terrible knowing that, should they wish to keep their job, they can in no way make a promise to provide a refund. 

I tested this request but coming at the issue again and again: let me cut free, refund my money for three continued weeks of poor to non-existent service, and let me come back in six weeks. Again and  again the rep would reply that the Beta version was coming soon, almost ready, close to completion. ""Soon."" They would never define the word ""soon"" for me and I finally closed the third chat session       without telling the rep we were done.

I contacted my payment source, PayPal Credit, employed deliberately for the protection I knew PayPal would provide for poor product design, failure to deliver, etc. PayPal filed a case for me with DirecTV NOW two weeks ago, and I learned today that my refund was coming in.

The money is now in my PayPal account, making me (I believe) the  first person who has complained about DTN to actually get their  money back.

3,2019-03-15 03:44:12,terryjohnson16,I dont intend to cancel...yet heres why,"I have the grandfathered $40 go big plan. Used to be $35. But i dont see the hype in the other competitors options. I looked at youtube tv offers, hulu tv etc and they all are missing channels that directv now offers the grandfathered plan members. Some are missing viacom channels while others are missing other major channels. Not one streaming company offers every major channel/network. They all have pieces of the pie and it gets you to think and choose which to take and at what price. 

If i switch i will losing more by switching. Yeah the price increased by $10 but the value is still for us grandfathered plan members. Value was still there even after they stopped allowing people to get the old $35/$40 grandfathered go big plan. That plan alone was $65. At that price its not worth it. 

I plan on hopefully keeping my grandfathered go big plan until they try to over price it. I have some people I recommended it to after their spectrum tv bill was reaching $200. 

Att wants people to drop the service so its less money they pay to the companies. 

Since the price increase rumor, people have been selling their $40 go big account here on reddit in record numbers. 

We all know att isn’t done yet raising their prices and channel reductions. 

Too bad the people that approve the stupid mergers don’t see how they companies lie just to get that approval. I wish there would be a scandal of how these companies pay/bribe the admins into these approvals. 

Im not a fan of john legere and the tmobile staff staying in trump hotels just to butter them up to get the merger approved with sprint but thats another topic...

The Osprey box will eventually support a variety of subscription options (Full DTV over IP / DTVN).  Potentially as early as Q4.

The upcoming un-named WarnerMedia Netflix competitor will have some kind of tie in to the DTV ecosystem. 

Things seem to be accelerating since the ATT Warner acquisition was formally approved so expect the rumor mill to heat up soon.

That was 2 weeks ago... as of tonight, I can still watch every channel on my Apple TV 4k and smartphones.    I've also gotten emails from them almost once a week with promo discount codes to get me to restart my service.

So what is going on?   They can't be charging me because I originally paid the 3 months of subscription using a Visa gift card  from a grocery store. It was purchased with cash and obviously my name was not on the card.  The card's balance went to 73 cents after I paid for the DirecTVNow subscription.   

Any ideas?

Compared to spectrum cable tv, its amazing. The phone app is sublime (seriously, i have no idea how i can stream hd tv (high bitrate hd too) over my lte despite not being able to watch youtube above 480p). I love how if i pause live tv on the phone app (android) when i hit play, it picks up where the show has moved on to and doesn't buffer. the price is great. hbo for 5 bucks? hell yeah. 

But when i downloaded the apps on our smart tv's, the experience wasn't the same. 

I'm not talking about the laggy ui (almost all smart tv's have a laggy ui. Tv's i don't think have much processing power) or the un-intuitive controls. I can handle those because they're no worse than spectrums app. 

The app... every maybe 30 minutes or so, it buffers for like 30 solid seconds. missing live tv. This isn't viable. I can't imagine missing 30 seconds of the latest hit series or something. 

I don't know why it happens. Its not the device because it happened on my roku tv (build in roku) and my fire stick on another tv. The screen will freezer for like 10 seconds, then the blue circle comes up for another 20, then it resumes. 

I don't get it. My internet is insanely fast. 

The phone app works fine. 

That said, the bitrate is phenominal. The hd looks almost 2k on my tv. Very good details etc. But it ""buffers"" if you can call it that. 

I don't know if there's a fix. Can i turn down the bitrate maybe? make it look more like normal hd? 

It isn't my internet, i clocked it at 120mbps this morning. 

If this doesn't get resolved i'm going back to spectrum. i haven't formally cancelled my plan yet.

\- $12.45 for our iphone 7’s total (we got deal where they paid base iphone payment over 24 months with trade-in of 6 or 6s... wife got 256 gb, i got 128 gb so we pay a 4.12 and 8.33)

\- $35 for DirecTV Now grandfathered Go-Big plan (we are completely on Apple TV 4K’s for TV)

\- $5 for HBO (I don't think we use it enough)

\- $13.99 for 4k Netflix

\- $10 Amazon Prime ($120/12)

\- $8.33 - Nest Camera ($100/12)

\- $7 - iCloud Storage $2.99 x 2

Problems include:

1. The DVR records shows that I didn’t ask it to
2. DVR randomly deletes episodes or entire shows that I asked it to record, even when there’s lots of space left
3. Recorded shows skip frames
4. Some recorded episodes are only minutes long. It records part of the “previously on”, then some commercials, then the recording is done
5. When trying to watch a recorded episode, I am frequently met with passive-aggressive pop ups saying “Looks like something’s wrong with your internet. Try again later”, even though my internet is fine and I can watch Netflix, Hulu and DirecTV Live with no issues. Other companies utilize more user-friendly wording, such as “Something went wrong. We’re working on fixing it.” The wording rubs me the wrong way because I’m already irritated lol


How can a feature that’s been in beta for a year be so terrible? Customer service wasn’t able to figure out the issue. From what I read on here, I’m not the only one with this issue.

2,2019-03-15 05:12:22,RobL24,Is DirecTV Now Really That Bad... (from a former Dish Network Subscriber)?,"I just became a Directv Now subscriber as of late February 2019. Dish Network didn’t have HBO, and I was getting concerned about GoT. Additionally, with HBO, my Dish Network bill was $132! I looked into cutting the cord in 2018, but Directv Now didn’t have a DVR back then, and the other services didn’t have all the channels I required (Nick Jr, MTV, VH-1, HGTV, and OWN... the wife watches OWN).

Since Directv Now had everything I needed, I did the 7-day trial. I was impressed! I have AppleTV 4K so I had excellent picture quality and 5.1 sound. I was saving $72/month, and I had the channels I actually watched versus a whole bunch of stuff I didn’t. Yeah, no RW on Live TV, and RW/FW sucks on on-demand/recorded programs (if even available); also, the guide sometimes gets stuck, and you have to close it, and then re-open it. One last thing, DVR sucks too as only 20 hours, and I am not able to see all the programs that I have it set to record. Otherwise, I thought the look and feel was very sleek (I like the channel surfing feature which no other service has?) in comparison to my Hopper 3. I do miss my Hopper 3’s 500 hour DVR capabilities though. 

I started hearing about the price hike and potential loss of channels so I started looking at other services. I didn’t see anything else that met my family’s needs. Yeah, I could get YouTube TV and Philo, but then I’d have to use two separate apps to see all the channels I want to see. Also, based on my research YouTube TV seemed to have less 1080P/60 FPS and 5.1 sound. Philo seemed to be even less in terms of picture quality (720P/30 FPS) and sound (Stereo) than YouTube TV. 

While I was hoping that I’d get an extra 100 hours with a non-Beta DVR with the $10 price hike, I didn’t. Overall, Directv Now’s superior picture quality, sound, and all-in-one solution works for me. I am still saving $60/month. 

I am hoping for improvements, but after the price hike and after hearing all the broken promises, I doubt we’ll see anything.

I feel like everyone who was extremely upset were on these ridiculously low plans that no way could have been maintained. I switched from Dish... saving $60/month right now is still great for me!

2. I already see a common issue. They are treating the channels you get for each plan like cable forcing you to cough off more money just for stations like CBS sports network which u actually can get for cheaper using fubotv and ps Vue. I would fix this by moving some of these channels around. Maybe add CBS sports network to the $40 and $55 plans seeing how there is a demand for the aaf currently.
3. Here is what the channel lineups for each package should be (excluding international):

2. Updated to new Directv Now Fire TV app today and noticed HBO was now missing. 
3. After chat for 50min w 2 reps I ask for a supervisor to call me. A call that lasted another hour.
4. The 1st chat rep has split my account into 2. One for HBO free for life n other for live a little plan. To watch hbo live I have to log into directv now with another login/pass. Could not be fixed.

Turns out my free 12 months of $35 plan was not free at all. I had payed 3 months $35/month off my card with no credits applied. Supervisor then said after 3 billing cycles I will get the 12 months free. I said it’s been 3 billing cycles already n I see where there is a new bill due. He said the 3 months has to start again because my att cell phone verification was mishandled 3months ago, even though the verification went thru for free HBO for life. 

So now he wants me to pay a total of 6 months then get 12 months free. Mind you I’m on Fire TV boxes 2nd gen and DTVN has been unusable until today’s 2.0. Still paid for VUE. I told them to cancel my account and I am switching cell service back to Verizon 2morrow who had only $2-3 worth of taxes as opposed to ATT’s $17 in taxes.

3,2019-03-11 19:31:02,jrzyjesse,DTVN greed is killing the service,"The forced commercials is unusable. I have to give a real world scenario to explain:

&#x200B;

I have a tv show series (Hoarders on A&E) that I have subscribed to. If I watch an episode, I am forced to watch six (6) consecutive commercials every few minutes.

&#x200B;

My wife and I enjoy watching the show, but don't care to watch the cleanup part, and in the past, would skip to the end of the show to see the final result.

&#x200B;

If we start watching the episode and want to skip to the end, I'm now forced to watch FIVE (5) SETS OF SIX (6) COMMMERCIALS so we can watch the last 10 minutes of the episode. So, I have to watch THIRTY (30) COMMERCIALS , which is roughly FIFTEEN (15)  MINUTES OF COMMERCIALS for FIFTEEN (15) MINUTES OF ACTUAL PROGRAMMING.

&#x200B;

We PAY for a subscription but DIRECTV NOW is double-dipping and getting paid by advertisers too! DTVN is competitive with traditional cable, but the service is far more restrictive than any other cable provider and this will ultimately FORCE US TO CANCEL OUR ACCOUNT!

&#x200B;

To sit down and try to watch 15 minutes of programming with my wife while my kids run around makes the service completely useless for us. It shouldn't take 30 minutes to see 15 minutes worth of TV.

While I am not entirely surprised that the legacy options are gone, it now means I am stuck with a $65 plan ( vs $40 from Live a Little ) until I determine my exit strategy.

Along with others I'm little irked about the price increases, but I'm willing to accept that it's a solid deal for what it is.  For my cell phone I'm on an old styled AT&T FamilyTalk Nation Plan with the grandfather unlimited data, which initially started as a $30 add on, but has slowly crept up to $45 over the past decade.  Currently pay my proportional part of that phone bill which ends up being around $85-ish a month.

I'm tempted to move my cell phone line over to an individual account, and switch to one of AT&T's newer Unlimited data plans to lower month costs.  The newer plans would let me also take advantage of features (like using my phone as a personal hotspot), that I currently do not have access to.  Free HBO and possible DirecTV Now or AT&T Watch discount would be an appreciated plus.

I currently have an indoor TV antenna, so access to regional networks is not an issue.  I also do not watch sports channels, and do not need the digital DVR access (though I'd rather have it than not).  Loss of TV app logins wouldn't be the end of the world either since I could subscribe to a service like Hulu for less than the amount I would save.

These are the three setups I'm considering:

1. AT&amp;T Unlimited and More Premium Plan ($80-ish) + Grandfathered DTVN Go Big ($40) + HBO ($0).  **TOTAL: $120ish**
2. AT&amp;T Unlimited and More Premium ($80-ish) +  DTVN Live a Little ($40) + HBO ($0) - Video Loyalty Credit ($15).  **TOTAL: $105ish**
3. AT&amp;T Unlimited and More Premium ($80-ish) +  AT&amp;T Watch TV ($0) + HBO ($0).  **TOTAL: $80ish**

All three possibilities would be cheaper than my current setup.  Just want to make sure there isn't a ""catch"" I'm overlooking, or a reason why I wouldn't want abandon my current grandfathered plans.

Any thoughts are appreciated!  Thanks!",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/95dxyl/switching_to_att_unlimited_and_more_premium_plan/,positive,0.9921
0,2018-08-02 03:01:14,drewdigg36,Roku slow loading of channels,"I have a new Roku Ultra and just signed up for DTV Now trial. 

Whenever I start a channel, change channels, start a DVR recording or come out of pause it takes forever to load.  I get the ""It's taking longer than expected to load"" message and then the message about something wrong with the network.  Eventually like 40 seconds later the show loads and then it runs great, no buffering, stuttering, etc.  Navigating through the UI and guide seems pretty snappy, it's just loading the actual content.

If I use the DTV Now app on my phone or PC on the same network it loads right away.  I don't have the same issues with other apps on the Roku.  Netflix loads super quick.  I am also doing a Youtube TV Trial and the channels change must faster there.  

Do other people have this problem with the DTV Now Roku app or is there something wrong with setup or Roku or something?

However, last night I called tech-support to report a problem and they offered me $10 a month off my next 3 bills for the next three months. 

After the support rep added the credit, I received an email that quoted my new discounted rate and further added  “when your promotion ends on (date) your total amount for Live a Little” will be $35.00 + tax.”  

On my payment history it used to say the next bill for August will be for $39 excluding tax. Now it says my next bill for August will be for $25 excluding tax. Time will tell if I get bumped back to the increased rate after my discount expires…

I’ve chatted with DirectTV NOW chat support way before the price went up n I was told many times that my plan won’t go up what so ever. 

I contacted them when I got the 1st email about the 5 dollars increase, I told them,I was told before that there would not be a price increase for grandfathered customers. I presented the chat transcript to the CSR, and they said there nothing they can do and they offered me a credit on my bill.

Now I get the email saying that my price will increase by $10, I then went back to the chat support and I said I have stuck with you guys since you guys first came out. I was told that my price will never increase because I git early pricing promo. Then the price increase by five dollars I contacted you guys and you guys in disregarded what I was told in regards to my price will never increase. But you guys reassured me that my plan will not be affected, I will only go out this one time for the five dollars so I accepted that.

Then you guys say that my price will increase by $10 that is not right, I feel like you guys are lying to people and thinking it’s OK.  I stuck by you guys every time you guys lie to me about my price would never increase and you guys still lied to me I need to get something for this cause this is a makes no sense.

I chatted with a manager n was told that he will email the higher ups to see what they can do for me n he offered me a 10 dollar credit.

&#x200B;

What I saw is one of the reasons I canceled DirecTV... holy cow, the streaming video was GORGEOUS! It was so superior to the satellite's compressed footage in every way, we were speechless. 

&#x200B;

Bye, satellite. Hello, streaming!

&#x200B;

Well, recently I signed up for directvnow... streaming = good, and their streaming dvr was something I wanted to try out.  So I recorded the first episode of American Horror Story: Apocalypse.

&#x200B;

There's a scene -- very mild spoiler here -- where the characters are walking around in some fine mist / fog.  And the compression was as bas as I've ever seen it.  You could count the gray blocks of mist, all over the screen.  Truly awful artifacting / banding.

&#x200B;

Is this ... normal for directvnow?  Is it because it was on their DVR, and not a live feed? Or is this what I can expect from their service, because they haven't learned shit from their satellite feeds?  

&#x200B;

EDIT:  No idea why it won't accept my PayPal. I was using the same Visa debit card that the DTVN site accepted under the credit card section, and can confirm that it works. The weird part is, DTVN charges $1 when you attach your payment to verify that it works, and then immediately re-funds the $1. I was seeing the $1 on my bank statement from PayPal, but DTVN would not process the change. I decided to test it with my Visa debit just in the credit section and add HBO to my plan. It charged me immediately a prorated amount of $1.50 for the rest of my billing cycle and the charge went through and shows on my bank statement.

0,2018-05-20 10:26:09,-DB-Cooper,DTV Now Questions,"I’m sure this is covered in a variety of posts, but there’s some ambiguous content on DirecTVs page and so many new features that I wanted to ask actual users some questions. I’m also considering YTTV. 

Background: I currently have DirecTV via satellite. I have an on-premise DVR (Genie), one wired receiver and one wireless receiver. We are HEAVY DVR users. Outside of sports and Formula1, we don’t watch live TV. We have a toddler who watches variously Disney things, VOD should work for him. My wife watches tons of sitcoms and dramas on network TV and a few on non-premium subscription channels (HGTV, etc). Anyways, we are moving across town and it’s a good time to consider modernizing. We have tons of Apple devices everywhere. Finally, DirecTV left a hole in my roof at my last home which ended up leaking, so I’m less interested in putting a dish up at the new place. 

Questions are:
- Is local TV (abc, fox, cbs, etc) available in Austin, TX? Their web site doesn’t let me check locals specifically. 

- 20 hours of DVR isn’t going to cut it for us. I understand a 100 hour package is coming for a small premium, when is that available?

- I read that many shows are available on VOD. Questions is: How soon would a network show be on VOD? For example, how soon after Modern Family airs would that episode be on VOD (circumventing the need for DVR)?

- Are shows on VOD impossible to fast forward, rewind, skip? Commercials are a total show stopper. 

- Are DVR shows converted to VOD automatically when available? This is both good and bad. Obviously it would help tremendously with DVR usage, but it may also prevent FF/REW and Skip controls. 

My major concern with YTTV is the reports that DVR shows are converted to VOD quickly and people can’t skip commercials. Wondering how this works in DTVNow? Also, I’m currently an ATT mobile customer and am enjoying large discounts for having video through ATT, so there’s some incentive to go with DTV. That said, YTTV is compelling as my experience with the DirecTV app on my legacy system and their overall abilities as a tech company are not as established as Googles. I also already have YT Red and am a big watcher of YT so that may help me consider YTTV. 

Anyways, thanks. Commercials being inserted into shows without FF will drive my wife and kids nuts so trying to get a handle on that on these new platforms.

1,2019-03-15 16:53:19,FranzKlammer,Question about Go Big & Shopping Around,"I currently pay $65/mo for Go Big + $5/mo for HBO, so $70/mo in total. I signed up probably a day before the new plans and had no idea about the massive changes they just implemented. Got my email yesterday about the $10 increase starting in May. Does that mean I can anticipate my bill going to $80/mo?   


I did some shopping around and I just can't find anything better that suits my needs. I'll list below some of my must haves:  


* All local channels (I'm in Tampa)
* Local sports channels
* Viacom - Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, etc.
* History
* HGTV
* Bravo
* NHL Network
* NFL Network
* HBO

Youtube TV is a no go for many reasons. I love the app and experience, but the channel lineup is too lacking. No native fire tv support is also a bummer. I know about the popular Philo add-on, but I prefer to keep everything in one app.   


Vue is missing viacom and I don't believe there's an NHL network option. Same complaints exist for Hulu.  


Sling is the closest thing I could find for my needs, but it is missing ABC and CBS and they dropped HBO. I could get Airtv, but again I prefer one app.  


Opinions? I know I've done a lot of the research myself, but $80/month just seems too steep. Plus, with these massive changes, I have little faith these old plans will last. I've generally had a great experience with DTVNow (aside from no native Nvidia Shield support), I just no longer trust them moving forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/b1h95g/question_about_go_big_shopping_around/,positive,0.2065
0,2019-03-14 02:30:55,Greeve78,Got screwed and looking for suggestions,"So, last night, with all the new plan info coming out, I decided to up my old plan from ""Live a Little"" to ""Gotta Have It"" to get grandfathered in.  In the process of doing this, I realized that apparently I had not been getting the ""Free HBO"" for also having an AT&T Unlimited mobile plan.  I had been paying 5 bux a month.  

&#x200B;

So I tried to validate my phone number and I got an error saying something stupid to the effect that I somehow couldn't add HBO to this plan.  It was a really stupid error message, but I digress.  In any case, I foolishly thought that if I somehow removed HBO from my current subscription, and then tried to re-validate my phone number, then I would get the bonus.  Of course that did not work.  After that I went back and tried to re-add HBO back to my sub, and low and behold, I could't add anything.  

&#x200B;

Come today, I can add HBO back to my plan, but the goddamn thing is now $15 and not the grandfathered rate.  I talked to the tech support folks in the horrible online chat window, and of course they couldn't do anything.  Does anyone have any recommendation?  Is there an actual number I can call?  I feel like their web page was garbage and screwed me out of my grandfathered HBO old price.  Makes me an angry sad panda.

I have lost access to all my locals and RSNs on my Apple TV and laptop due to this.

I've been chatting with DTVN support for 2 hours, and even got a call back from their tech support. What they said was:

a) the recent storms on the east coast might be causing ISPs to reroute their internet traffic.

b) I should ask my ISP for a static IP address. I explained this was not an option. I would have to upgrade from a residential to a business account and then purchase a block of static IP addresses ... this would add big $ to my monthly internet bill.

c) I should reboot my router several times to see if I can get a new IP address assigned. I tried this several times, and keep getting the same public IP address.

d) Call my ISP to have them assign me a new IP address.

I'm waiting for a call back from my ISP to see if they can assign me a new IP address to help the situation. But I am astounded that DTVN support won't take any responsibility for this issue! DTVN's response was basically ""It's your problem, and you need to take care of it. There's nothing we can do.""

I'm posting this as an FYI in case anyone  is having similar problems. Personally, problems like these confirm that DTVN is simply not ready for prime time, and I should either try another OTT service or go back to traditional cable TV.

Sometimes they show up again in the Roku app, but mostly not, depending on the mood of the app at that time.

* There is no way to ""delete-protect"" recordings, other providers let users designate recordings from being deleted by newer recordings

* While the 100 hours DVR option supposedly has been released, I have not seen any such option to upgrade to that. And even if it was there, if the plan is still to delete recordings automatically after 90 days, then a 100-hour function would be useless anyway, as at least I do not have that much time to watch 100 hours’ worth of recordings in any one 90-day period. There should be no automatic deleting, unless so much is recorded that space is needed by overwriting the oldest recording (unless that was designated as “do not delete”. All these fucntions have been available by legacy TV providors (cable, fiber, etc.) for ages.

* Volume differs greatly from one channel to another on DTVN and is generally much louder than other sources (PlayStation, etc.), requiring serious volume adjustments made ahead of switching to DTVN to keep from experiencing a volume-shock. Other apps on that same Roku like Hulu and Sling and Netflix put out volume in line with other sources, showing again that DTVN is at fault.

If it was not for the fact that the two really important parts of this DTVN service, picture quality and channel availability, are better than that of most other tested providers, there would be no reason to use DTVN due to the numerous annoyances and bugs and the fact that there is no way to even tell DTVN about it due to lack of a contact method, other than the helpless people who answer the useless “chat” option from a country on the other side of the globe.

I would bet you'll see increases for Hulu announced soon.

I'd venture to guess this is because many of the networks are losing viewers due to cord cutting and other entertainment leading to lower viewership ratings. 

Networks (like A&E, MTV, USA, etc)  make money in two ways. Ads, which they charge the advertisers for, and the fees they charge the MVPDs (cable and satellite companies) per user to carry the network.

As fewer people are watching tv (because of netflix, video games, internet etc) the networks bring in lower revenue from advertisers, who pay per eyeball.  Obviously, if a channel is seeing lower ratings, they won't pay as much because the ad isn't hitting as many potential target watchers. [https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/20/how-do-cable-companies-make-their-money.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/20/how-do-cable-companies-make-their-money.html)

The other way networks make money is by charging the MVPD/cable/satellite providers per user. Often this is pennies,  but can go up to $7 for networks like ESPN. ([https://blogs.wsj.com/numbers/how-much-cable-subscribers-pay-per-channel-1626/](https://blogs.wsj.com/numbers/how-much-cable-subscribers-pay-per-channel-1626/) They charge this whether you watch or not.

The networks, seeing lower ad revenue are re-negotiating these per user rates with the MVPDs to be higher. Otherwise, the network would be losing money. In turn, all of the Virtual MVPDs are having to raise the prices that the consumers (you and I) pay or risk losing money because they would be paying the networks more than they bring in.

In that year, DTVN has DVR and all of the channels we watch. I had some questions so I did an online chat with a DTVN rep and this is what I found, coming here for validation:

Basically all channels have a 72hr rewind meaning I can start a show before it finishes to skip commercials without having to wait for it to finish (7-9p show, start watching at 8p) and have a faux-DVR for all shows within that 72hrs. 

However, he said not all channels have DVR as an option so I asked him for a list, he could not provide one. Does anyone have any insight to this?

I guess my thought is I come back home after a week away, are some of my shows just gone if not available on Hulu?

Any insight/advice is appreciated. I plan on doing a trial run with the free week in the next couple weeks but wanted to try and get some questions answered before then. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/8so3j4/evaluating_dtvn_dvr_questions/,positive,0.7438

Is it better than YTTV + Philo? 

Yeah, I know Directv Now has the interface/DVR Issues/etc, but if I was going to drop Directv Now for what everyone seems to be talking... the YTTV + Philo combination; based on my quick research, Directv Now Plus + Philo doesn’t seem to be that bad of an option!

You’d get 1080P/60 FPS with the better bit rate and 5.1 sound!

I don’t have Philo, but assuming it can work with Apple TV’s TV App, then you technically could go to TV App and find programming for both in one location (although you’d have to remember which DVR has your programs)... this same issue would exist for Apple TV users with YTTV + Philo.

0,2018-09-30 13:15:45,Xented,FYSA: DirectTV Deceitful Tactics with Free Apple TV Promo (X-Post with Apple Subreddit),"Hello everyone,

Just wanted to let everyone know that canceling their Direct TV Now subscriptions is likely much more difficult than they originally thought.  I've included the transcript and background below.

&#x200B;

The Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF):  DirectTV Now uses deceptive tacts to keep you with the service, and then when canceling will not issues a refund for employing said tactics.  They have also risen the cost of the month-to-month by 5 dollars, not informing the consumers who have prepaid the 3 months @ 30 dollars.  **This is not about the cost of the subscription but the ridiculously unfriendly consumer attitude they have.**  

&#x200B;

Backstory:  I cancelled DirectTV Now approximately 2 weeks ago (before ending my pre-paid trail would end.  I then today  checked my account and realized that there was a charge for the next month.  I cancelled it again today, but again was frustrated by the literally four screens it took to cancel my subscription (it still wasn't cancelled).  Only after I contacted customer service did it actually go through.  

&#x200B;

I'd like to apologize for some of the wrong words used, I was using my phone and autocorrect did not assist in some cases.  Also Ron was very nice, and tried to assist within his capabilities, but frankly this is a tactic that AT&T/DirectTV is using.  

&#x200B;

Here is the transcript: 

&#x200B;

**AT\&amp;T** : Hi, I’m DIRECTV NOW's virtual assistant. How can I help you today?

**Me** : I already cancelled my plan and or charge me this month

**DIRECTV NOW** :Did you cancel the service during a free trial? 

* Yes
* No

**Me** : Yes

**DIRECTV NOW** :Accounts canceled after 7pm EST time on the last day of a free trial, will be charged for an additional month.  
**For example**: You subscribe to a 7 day trial on May 1st. If you cancel on or before May7th at 7pm ET, you will not be charged. If you cancel on May 8th, you will be charged.  
**Was this information helpful?**

* Yes
* No

**Me** : No

**DIRECTV NOW** :Let me get you to a specialist. To assist you better, please tell us your first name.

**Me** : REDACTED

**DIRECTV NOW** :Thank you. You will now be connected to a live chat specialist who will assist you.**Ron** : Hi! My name is Ron. I can help you with your account.

**Ron** : Nice to meet you, REDACTED.

**Me** : hey Ron, is like a refund for this last months billing

**Me** : I had already cancelled once and just had to cancel again

**Me** : and it was not in the last day of service

**Ron** : I understand, let me review your account and help you with the information.

**Me** : frankly your website is deceitfully hard to cancel and I foresee a class action lawsuits in your future**Me** : but I did make it through to cancellation

**Ron** : I am sorry to hear that. I have checked and see that you have canceled the service now.

**Me** : yeah I cancelled the service already two weeks ago as well, but saw a charge on my credit card this morning**Ron** : I see, let me check what best I can do for you

.**Ron** : May I know the amount and date you have been charged?

**Me** : also when signing up for the service it was 30 dollars, now it's 40. Kinda deceptive to increase the price during a free trail where you prepay for four months. All that being said I know you are not responsible for these practices.**Me** : One sec I'll get you the charge date and charge account

**Me** : amount\*

**Ron** : Sure.

**Me** : 39.45 on the 27sep

**Ron** : Thank you.,

**Ron** : I am sorry if you feel in that way, the price of the package previously was $35 and you have been charged accordingly and from effectively July 26th, the price has been increase by $5. However, you have been charged $35 plus taxes only for this month. The $40 price will be effective from next month on this account

.**Ron** : If you have canceled the account, you would have received confirmation email, have you received any confirmation email about the cancellation when you have canceled the service before?**Me** : that's fine, although deceptive. My biggest concern is that I was charged after cancelling your service. I'd imagine your going to get many complaints about this as you have to click on an account cancellation button four times, each time making it difficult to see if you actually cancelled your account. Was my account not cancelled?

 **Me** : I did get an email thank you, if still like a refund for a service I believed was cancelled

**Me** : I'd\*

**Ron** : I understand, the cancellation process would not be completed before and that might be the reason the account is not canceled.

**Me** : Why not?

**Ron** : You might not have followed the complete process for that.

**Ron** : If you have canceled the account before, you would have received cancellation email before as well.**Ron** : Have you received it when you try to cancel for the fist time?

**Me** : Okay well if highly encourage direct TV now to take a look at the cancellation process on their website. I did not receive the email with time. I'd like to think I'm pretty computer savvy.

**Ron** : I understand, I will forward this to our technical team regarding this.

**Me** : I'd like a refund please for the last month charged. 

**Ron** : Please allow me a minute here/

**Me** : Sure

**Ron** : Thank you.

**Ron** : I am sorry for the delay

2,2019-04-29 08:26:51,BobsFlops,Paramount Network (and other channels) only DirecTVNow table during commercials.,"Hey everybody,

&#x200B;

maybe you observed it before but when I was watching the Paramount Network yesterday, I always had a table during the whole commercials which says ""We are right back after the short break"" or similar.

It's with the AT&T sign etc. This lasts as long as the commercial break is on.

So do they have the rights to show commercials, don't they?

&#x200B;

It's extreme on the paramount network and sometimes on the others. But not during the whole commercials like on this channel.

So is this norma having a 2-3 minutes table during commercials?

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong that the commercials are loved by me but it's a bit strange that it's silence and only this table showing up.

My suggestion would be the app menu should be the remote menu button and a long press of that menu button would directly bring up the program guide.  Then the left/right/up/down can be used with the more common skip back/forward and channel up/down functions.

Also - in the beta - the sound drops out when navigating a menu or the guide.  Seems like an issue with a system sound effect impacting the stream sound.

0,2018-06-24 23:55:11,JoyousGamer,Have a FireTV and AppleTV? Use the FireTV,"First off know that I am not the biggest fan of the AppleTV to start with. The touch controls I feel cause a input delay I don't get from my other devices.

I am just throwing this out there after using my AppleTV for the first time for DTVN in about a month and a half. The AppleTV app is so inferior its not even funny. (To be clear my AppleTV has been used for HBO/Netflix with no issues so this is not a device issue)

For clarity: On the same network, both on wifi (ATV is actually closer than the FireTV), and been a DTVN subscriber since day 1 (I know how to fix issues and what is ""common"" for my house).

Issues I had
-
- DVR was slow, dropping half the show, and had lots of buffering (example I stopped a show in the middle, went upstairs to the APTV [had to log in], and had these issues on that same episode as well as others I tried)
- Needing to login multiple times (known issue)
- Extra ordinary additional buffering on live tv typically not on FireTV (was not watching a sporting event just normal rerun shows)
- This is personal but swipe not showing the Watch Now/Guide is extremely annoying (it asks for you to push the Menu button)
- Apple TV got stuck in the DVR section of the app with incorrect screen display (DVR show information overlaps the headers)

This is not meant to tear down the service but simply to point out at this point if you have the choice between devices use the FireTV. Its been about a month since I used the Roku (had Beta but not the live version) and I would say if that hasn't changed that Roku would be a better option as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/8tm1k0/have_a_firetv_and_appletv_use_the_firetv/,negative,-0.444

I signed up based on the mix of local stations and basic cable, but this is certainly feels like a bait and switch. 

I tried to DVR a few network shows (this is not a DVR complaint) but they all end up losing about 1/3 of the show. I realized after watching live that the channels show up as “this content has an issue and can’t play” for minutes at a time. Whatever method they are using to capture local channels here is completely unwatchable right now. 

I’ve chatted with customer service several times and stated the errors I was seeing. No mention about issues with local stations. When they say they are going in to fix it, I can only assume they are refreshing/re-authorizing the account each time. They’re nice but wholly ineffective. I’d love to send in a help ticket and get an idea if this is something that could possibly be fixed in the near term or not. How to go about doing that isn’t very obvious.

The Roku works a lot better and doesn't have the buffering issues. My only issue is I can't view the guide through the DTVN app because the only way I was able to get it to work was access DTVN through the Roku app. Is there any other way that I just don't know about that might make it possible for me to view the guide from my phone instead of on the TV?

Since the rollout of the new version, I haven't been able to load anything. Not the guide, not channels, nothing. Not just buffering or laggy, the blue loading bar fills the screen but I don't get anything but a black screen.

I've uninstalled the app, rebooted the Roku, and reinstalled to no luck. I've also tried just unplugging it, with a similar lack of results. The official support website offers no real solutions (Haven't contacted customer service yet), and it's getting pretty old not having been able to use a service I paid for during the last couple weeks. I really don't want to switch since I've enjoyed the service so much, but I like Roku (Every other app on mine streams perfectly) and am definitely not going to buy a different device because of DTVN's blundering.

UPDATE: After two weeks, and another chat with customer support, we went through a bunch of the same steps (Power cycling, rebooting modem, changing ID), and now it's decided to work again. No idea what actually did it, but I changed my user ID, reinstalled the app, powered down the Roku, and then rebooted my modem, and after all that I'm back to watching TV.

1,2019-01-09 23:48:23,Ventem,First impressions so far,"So I’ve been wanting to try out DirecTV Now for a while, as they have a lot of channels. Notably Viacom and AMC, which Hulu Live does not offer. I’ve been with Hulu for some time now, and have always been happy with the service. 

My first impressions were... really bad, I hate to say. 

So I signed up for the trial with the highest tier available (can’t remember what they call it) plus HBO. Awesome. Everything’s cool, and I’m excited to “channel surf” with a real channel guide. 

And my account is locked. I typed my info in correctly, and immediately my account is already locked? Weird, but whatever. Maybe I did type it in incorrectly? I was prompted to change my password, and did so. I literally changed it to the same thing (weird that their system let me change my password to the same thing) and tried again. 

Locked. 

Now I’m getting a little frustrated. Went through all that again, changed my password to something different this time, and tried again. 

You guessed it, locked out. But this time I was prompted to get a hold of customer care. Great, I’ve heard stories of AT&T’s customer care. Not looking forward to this. At all. 

They offered to reset my password for me to a temp one, and unlocked my account. Okay, cool. Maybe there was just a hiccup somewhere. Used my temp password and I’m in!! Changed my password real quick, and I was prompted to log back in. Okay, cool. This looked promising. 

I log back in and I’m locked. At this point, I’m just done. I almost wanted to ask the rep to just cancel everything and remove my payment info from the account. Before I did that, they offered to make me a new trial account. I’m super iffy about that because wouldn’t I be ineligible for a second trial with my card and be charged right away? Yes, I would. They said no, but I know how these thinks work. The system would charge me straight away. 

Before I ask them to cancel before I even got to try the service, I decided to try to login one more time. 

It worked. Suddenly, it worked. I’m baffled. I thank the rep for their time and *finally* get to try the service. 

The stream quality is great. The sheer amount of channels I get is awesome. I’m actually kind of amazed, to be honest.

Almost worth the amount of time it took just to get this shit set up. The only thing that’s really stopping me from fully switching is the lack of on-demand. Yes, they have *some*, but it’s nothing compared to Hulu’s vast library. Granted, that’s not really the purpose of DirecTV Now, so I should have expected that. 

And, of course, the fear of their obviously terrible systems screwing something up in the future. 

I’ll give it some more time, but I could probably give up some on-demand in favor of more options for live TV. 

Those who have been with DirecTV Now for a while, how are you guys liking it? Has anyone here switched from Hulu Live to DirecTV Now? I’d love to hear other’s thoughts and opinions. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/aed00w/first_impressions_so_far/,positive,0.9953

Q: What broadcast networks are supported?

>In select markets, where the Network owns the station and it is not a local affiliate, the following broadcast networks are currently available.

Q: Are there other ways I can get access to broadcast networks?

>Yes, there are plenty of setups you can run with an OTA antenna. You can use the antenna by either plugging it directly into the TV, using a TV tuner and the Channels app if you use an Apple TV, or a myriad of other choices if you use another device, such as PlexWMC, or any numerous Kodi add-ons that work with other PVR services.

Q: What about football and regional sports networks? (*From [TheVerge](http://www.theverge.com/2016/11/30/13788934/directv-now-att-internet-tv-service-questions-pricing-channels)*)

>DirecTV Now does not carry NFL Sunday Ticket or the Red Zone channel. If a game is on a channel that Now does stream, you should be able to tune in. **Blackout rules apply, and Verizon maintains its exclusive streaming rights on smartphones**, so you can’t watch the NFL there. Your TV or laptop should work fine, though. 

>Availability of regional sports networks will vary by your location; the YES network is part of DirecTV Now in New York, for example. AT&T says these are offered in other areas of the US:

>•Comcast SportsNet: Bay Area, California, Chicago, Mid-Atlantic, New England

I'm a DTV Now subscriber and I use the DVR every now and then. It's strange that it's been in beta for so long, but with how many problems I have with it and how convoluted it can seem at times maybe they're trying to figure out a better way to expose the functionality.

I'm currently taking a computer interface course for my master's in computer science and I'm tasked with some of my work for doing a mock redesign of an existing interface. Part of this coursework involves needfinding (this is really busywork....).

I'd very much appreciate if you could take a couple minutes to respond to my survey below. It's only 8 questions (I made 6 of them multiple choice and only 2 ask for comments, and they aren't required at all). Thanks!

""One of the biggest differences between Hulu's live TV service and others is that it's heavily reliant on its on-demand service as a replacement for DVR. If a user ""records"" a show that's available on Hulu's on-demand service, Hulu will simply show that user the on-demand version of that episode.

The user benefits because they'll see fewer commercials than the regular broadcast recording. Hulu says it shows less than half the number of ads as regular broadcast television. Hulu benefits because it gets to keep the ad revenue instead of the original broadcast network.""

Current plans will go up $10 in price effective April 12th. If I sign up today with the ""Gotta Have It"" I will see a price change next month but still keep my channels?

I have some questions if anyone came here from Dish. How was the TV quality though? When working, was there pixilation? It seems like they might use lower resolution streams though and compress more, so I'm wondering how much crappier the picture will be.

Wondering if anyone who came here from Dish Network has any feedback. All the ""review"" sites seem to be sponsored and biased to one or the other.

One of these items is the DVR service. With Sling they have limitations that you can't record espn and disney channels  (I'm assuming it has to do with commercial skipping?) .

Looking at the DTVN information I see no obvious mention of such a  limitation, but of course I had to dig pretty deep into Sling information to find this. Can an actual customer confirm this?

I forced stopped the app thinking this would help, went back in, and was still able to access the app and all the channels. 

Is there some way to force a log out on all devices? Customer Service assured me changing the password would force all devices to re-login but it didn't.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/ad2o3c/password_change_logout/,negative,-0.4854

Only problem is my picture is jerky/choppy, i.e. microfreezing every 20-30 seconds, just enough to bug you.  My internet is 60 Mbps and the Fire TV is connected via ethernet.  I've tried frame rate matching on and off but it made no difference.  I didn't have this problem with my Cube.  Any ideas?

3,2019-01-03 18:42:28,Loadedlulu,Account Locked Upon Creation,"I recently decided to cut the cord and after countless hours of research decided to try Directv Now first. I created an account last night and immediately tried to log in on chrome. I received the following message: 

“We had to lock your account.

To keep your information safe, we've temporarily locked your account after too many unsuccessful login tries.
We want to help!

(LU003)”

I followed the instructions and chatted with a support representative who instructed me to create a completely new account and they would refund my previous order.

The new account had the exact same error upon first log in.

Interesting note is that I was able to login on my Roku. The only common thing between the two accounts I created was the email, which is also the same email as my att wireless account.

Chat support basically told me they would reset the lock and have a supervisor reach out. MyATT support told me that their account systems are currently down and that I should call back in a few hours. Anyone else have this issue and figured out a resolution?

Those that have used the AppleTV and the Firestick, how do they compare for DTVN? I get a lot of connectivity issues and error messages  with the ATV and wondering if I’ll encounter the same with a Firestick. 

Also, off tangent a little as I’m asking this question not for the DTVN app (and pardon my technological ineptitude) but does one need a Firestick if you have a smart TV or a PS4, for example where you can stream things like Netflix. I’m asking bc I want to gift my niece a Firestick for college, but I know she has a PlayStation4 where she streams Netflix. Would she get any benefit from a Firestick?

2,2018-12-25 02:34:10,CrewsMachine,"DTVN, Roku, and Harmony macro question - possibly Firestick is need be","I'm trying to setup a Harmony 665 and a Roku Premiere with only DTVN installed for my 70 yr old mother to use. As it seems no streaming service is as comfortable and second nature as operating a traditional cable service I want to set up macros to get to the various areas of the UI to be as easy as possible to help the transition away from traditional cable. The emphasis on as easy as possible. When an issue inevitably occurs and I get a frantic phone call I'd like to be able to walk her through the  steps to fix the issue at hand easily.

I know that macros can be a powerful tool to achieve this and I want to set them up so she has one button to go to her favorite channels under the Guide section. I also want to be able to setup a button to go to DVR. I understand that all of this can be done by adding in the sequence of button presses required to get to the various areas of the UI but I am running into a big issue right from the beginning.

While my Roku remote come standard with a NOW button to go directly to  the app the choices for Roku in the My Harmony app do not include a DTVN option. Is there a  work around? Also, I have a Firestick that I can use (while returning the Harmony 665 in favor of the remote with hub option) if this would help me make this as easy a transition as possible for Mom.
