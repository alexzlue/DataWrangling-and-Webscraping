samsung,1368,2019-03-02 06:49:41,tubeii,"Dear Samsung, thank you for keeping the headphone jack on your Galaxy S10 series. Please continue to keep doing it because we all appreciate it.","(tldr at bottom)

&#x200B;

Samsung is essentially the only true competitor left in the smartphone market that have retained the headphone jack on their phones. Most of the competition have removed the headphone jack from their phones, but Samsung's newly released Galaxy S10 series still keep it, and I am so grateful for that.

By now, most people are very aware of companies removing the headphone jack from their phones, and although most people are familiar as to why it's a bad idea, I'd like to reiterate on the main reasons:

* The headphone jack is still a feature that **many** people use (and it isn't necessarily entitled to headphones).
* Bluetooth audio is not as reliable as just sticking in your headphones and listening. (More on this later) Also, dongles are not fun.

But my personal problem with removing the headphone jack is slightly different. I personally own a pair of Bluetooth headphones and absolutely adore the comfort in using them for running, and I think it's awesome to see the new advancements we make in Bluetooth technology day by day. But I was bothered by the idea that phone manufacturers were taking it away to force us into this new ""wireless future,"" even when they very clearly have space to retain the headphone jack. It's lazy and it's not innovation of any sort.

Again, it's awesome that Bluetooth headphones get increasingly better, and I support the new addition of this technology. I also know that to criticize the companies who have already done away with the headphone jack is completely useless; they have moved on. But we still have one company left. **Samsung**.

So why am I writing this post then?

These days it's so normal to see a phone without a headphone jack, and the pressure from other phone companies to join this trend is growing. Hell, I wouldn't be surprised if Samsung is facing some serious flack from others for not being ""progressive"" and doing the same. As the release of the Galaxy Note 10 slowly speculates, this is where we need to show gratitude to Samsung for not giving into the pressure to remove the headphone jack, but also give Samsung a helping hand to stay this way. **We like the headphone jack and please keep it.**

There's so much satisfaction in the small things a headphone jack can do that we take for granted. It's awesome that I can use an AUX cord to plug my phone into my friend's car to play music. It's awesome that I can pull out my tangled earbuds and plug them into listen to music on the subway. And I'm sure many, many others still appreciate it. 

So Samsung, thank you for keeping the headphone jack on your new flagships. Please continue to do so.

&#x200B;

Tl:dr, the headphone jack is still a great feature that people use. Bluetooth technology is great but it's still not as reliable. Samsung, you are a blessing for keeping it on your new Galaxy phones and please don't give into the pressure around you and remove it in your upcoming releases.",https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/awezjq/dear_samsung_thank_you_for_keeping_the_headphone/

samsung,476,2019-04-29 10:29:53,mikelmao,My samsung galaxy S9+ fell from a 4 story building,"Hello guys,

&#x200B;

Yesterday I was in bed watching some youtube video's whilst slowly slipping away from reality to my night of happy thoughts and dreams. I notice myself falling asleep, so like every night I gather my last piece of energy to turn off the phone and put it on the window-sill. The window open's horizontally instead of vertically, and it is attached to a metal hook which leaves it very slightly open. Just enough to get a little bit of fresh air in the room.

&#x200B;

After putting my phone on the window-sill I relax all my muscles and prepare for my well deserved night of sleep. Suddenly, after letting go of my phone, I suddenly hear a 'click'. 'There shouldn't be a click' I think to myself whilst slowly waking up. Again a 'click' so I immediately jump up, instantly waking up, realizing the click was my phone exactly fitting into the opening of the window. The 2nd click was it actually falling out of the window as the opening is exactly the same size as the phone and there is a small piece of wood which sticks out between the window-sill and window where it clicked out of.

&#x200B;

As I start cold sweating that my newly purchased galaxy s9+ has attempted to fly and will explode into a thousand small pieces when it hits the ground, I hear a 'thump' of it hitting the floor. I walk out of the room in despair, look at my girlfriend and without blinking say 'I just threw my phone out of the window'. After explaining what happened she bursts into laughter and started to put on her shoes to come out with me to check its remains.

&#x200B;

When reaching the outside area, my phone seems nowhere to be found. Above us was a small wooden platform (about 4 meters above us), upon climbing the platform I notice a shiny object laying on the wood. I reach out to grab it and my phone has been retrieved. I inspect my phone and prepare myself for the mess it will be. NOT A SCRATCH TO BE FOUND. I checked it in detail for about 5 minutes in unbelief that I can literally not find any impact scratch or anything else. Somehow, it fell in a perfect way and probably bounced back because of the wooden planks, lessening the impact even further.

&#x200B;

I write this post just to say damn Samsung, idk what this phone is built from, but thats some strong materials :') And thanks random chance, for putting a wooden platform right above the floor xD

&#x200B;

 **TL;DR** \- I was falling asleep so turned off my phone, instead of putting it on the window-sill it fell out of the window, dropped 4 stories down and had literally no scratch on it what so ever.",https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/binwzj/my_samsung_galaxy_s9_fell_from_a_4_story_building/
samsung,471,2018-09-13 12:58:37,Antony66GR,There are rumors that the next OnePlus phone won't have a headphone jack. Samsung is the only company that still has a headhone jack on all its phones and no notch. Thank you Samsung.,I didn't like Samsung in the past but now all the other phones are shameless Iphone copies. And they copy only the bad things. Why not copy Apple's software optimization? Or copy the Taptic engine?      Samsung is the only one that adds features to their phones and isn't removing existing ones.

I've been an avid Apple user for a long time. I always knew Android phones had superior hardware, but the reason I stuck with Apple was their iOS and App Store. With the release of S10 and an iPhone 6s that's starting to show its age, i'm switching to an S10 Plus. I'm ready to embrace Android and give it a try. The S10 Plus has superior hardware and I feel like Android has been polished a ton the past few years. I'm just tired of Apple's extreme prices compared to what you're actually getting.

samsung,187,2019-03-31 22:22:55,SuitingUncle620,Samsung Mobile has been Acquired by Apple Inc. - Megathread,"Hey r/Samsung,

It’s with great sadness and sorrow that we announce Samsung Mobile has been acquired by Apple. 

> *After the failure of Samsung’s latest flagship, the S10, and due to the high production costs and low demand for the Galaxy Fold, the company has lost its high share value, causing Apple Inc to buy those shares and effectively take over the Samsung Mobile devision by force.*

We have reflected the new *announcement* by updating our banner to represent the future of Samsung. We believe in the future, and we truly believe Apple will bring a lot to the table.

Apple is at the forefront of innovation. They always strive to do better, and this will really improve the quality of Samsung smartphones going forward.

Please keep all discussion about this dramatic happening here. All current Samsung Smartphones will be receiving iOS 12.2 later today.

Spent about 2  hours trying to find it last night and I couldn't but I went back this morning after the roads were plowed and it was right there sitting in the road covered in water and off. So I walked home all happy about finding it and when I tried to turn it on it worked!

samsung,153,2018-06-22 02:23:28,Sacmo77,"I won, was taking Samsung into arbitration and won over the trade is program.","So I been dealing with this for almost 2 months now.

I got a galaxy s9 and traded in my old device to Samsung and was offered 300 dollars. 

I was taking advice of others on this very Reddit about taking pictures before sending in the device for review.

However once Samsung received the device they found damage, so they sent me a picture of the damage. It was a damaged housing around the charging port on the phone. I was like huh, that odd. The pictures I have contradict the photo they took and sent me.

So Samsung decided to charge back 275 dollars of the 300 they originally offered me. I was then able to contact customer service and explain the situation and that I had photos.

They basically gave me a run around and was then led to the online customer e commerce team which still denied me a refund. I even showed them all 9 of my photos and still were denying my charge back request.

So I proceeded to the BBB (Better Business Bureau) filed a complaint against Samsung and posted my pictures and let it be, after about a month of back and forth with Samsung about this issue, BBB decided enough was enough and asked if I would like to go to arbitration. I agreed.

Well just 2 weeks ago I faxed in the form accepting arbitration against Samsung. they said they would find a third party arbitrator in the mean time to handle this issue with Samsung.

Well, today I just got notification that Samsung did not want to go into arbitration and refunded my full amount.

Thanks BBB and reddit for the help on fighting Samsung on this issue.

I know I have seen some people have similar issues with Samsung trade in program as well.

But thanks again, felt the need to share this with some of you going through what I had to deal with.",https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/8sxqgg/i_won_was_taking_samsung_into_arbitration_and_won/

I don't think I can switch the another phone without pressure sensitive home buttons again (Iphone X with the swipe up home gesture)",https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/9pjyp6/is_it_just_me_or_is_the_pressure_sensitive_home/

samsung,133,2019-04-07 05:38:00,azirking01,Discussion: Things are getting out of control in this sub. We are growing rapidly but all we have to show for ourselves is 200-some pictures of the S10 and Galaxy Buds. We should strive to post better stuff frankly. Lots of pretty good examples of large tech subreddits exist,"
We need to think strategically about what kind of place we want the Samsung subreddit to be. Over the past few days an overload of low effort pictures of the S10, buds etc have become the only thing the sub has to offer. In the beginning these were phenomenal and exciting. But of course not only do they become annoying, they drown out intelligent discussion and other people's posts never see the light of day. 

Additionally, I can see that people are not posting their pictures  in the picture thread. I get it. They want greater visbility - - but the issue is no one gets visibility if everyone posts on the main thread. This is why photo threads are useful, to curate and highlight photos. 

Samsung is a crazy large company. It doesn't make sense that a Samsung subreddit only has photography posts and photos of your cellphones. There are so many other things that this company does. What do you guys think? I like to see the Apple sub as good example of technology discussion on Reddit. I think we should strive towards something similar and I believe we can get just as big. 

Mods are not being able to keep up with all the photography posts being submitted, specially during the excitement of the S10 unveil and the months following that. The sub is growing rapidly and frankly there is too much content for them to properly moderate. My hope is that we make the effort to post high quality content and we follow subreddit rules of posting-- those rules  may seem lame but they ultimately help the visibility of our posts.

samsung,136,2018-11-03 15:22:30,dronningmargrethe,Hated Samsung for many years. Bought S9+ yesterday.,"My first real phone was a Samsung S3. The phone in itself was good, but the software.. ugh. Bloat upon bloat upon bloat, felt like samsung was forcing poorly designed apps down my throat, and I couldn't escape it. So since then I stayed the hell away Samsung.

Having become an avid android auto user, I needed a phone that worked perfectly with AA, and the only brand to reliably do that, is Samsung. So I was kind of forced to buy the S9+.

And my god - this phone is brilliant. Gone is the crappy UI, and it's replaced with a cohesive, polished UI, that I actually prefer over stock android. I can disable the Samsung apps if I want. I don't even have to install most of the them. The ones I have tried, are actually good.

The build quality is great. The screen is great. It's got a headphone jack, Qi charging, waterproof etc. I love the ""always on"" display, great feature. The notification light can be controlled, unlike on my Huawei. Hands down the best phone I have tried! It seems like Samsung have finally understood that functionality is equally important to design. Also the fingerprint reader is so much better than on the S8, that I briefly tried.

There are actually only two downsides.

- Bixby. Samsung - get rid of this shit.

- the 18:9 aspect. I don't get it. I don't need that extra space, and now it doesn't fit in a jeans front pocket.

samsung,108,2018-07-23 20:52:02,Bodycount9,YES! Finally won my BBB complaint against Samsung for a trade in,"Thanks to u/Sacmo77, his advice said to file a complaint with the BBB about a trade in I did with Samsung for my Note 8.  I traded in a perfectly good working Galaxy 7 Edge for what I thought would be $400 credit.  They received it and said there was an internal connector broken and said I will only get $25 credit and I can't get the phone back.  The phone was in perfect working order.  Charged fine.  No scratches on the screen.  wireless charged just fine.  It was perfect.  

Their first communication was Jan 10th and I've been going back and forth with them since then.  Finally I saw a post on here from Sacmo77 who said he filed a BBB complaint against them and won.  So that's what I did.  

Process took about a month and during that time they replied to the BBB saying they reviewed the case and that their statement was valid and the case was closed.  I replied back stating I wanted to take this to arbitration and to bring the phone with them to prove a connector was damaged.  They said ""upper management"" will review my case.

Finally today the BBB emailed me saying I had a new message.  Samsung reviewed it with upper management and said they will refund me the $375 to my credit account I have with them.

It's OVER!  Finally!

I'm never using Samsung trade in again!  I don't care what offers they give out.  NEVER AGAIN!

samsung,89,2018-10-01 16:11:41,IAMBEOWULFF,My experience with the Note 9 so far.,"I've pretty much had every flagship since the Samsung Galaxy S2. Including a few Notes. 

The first phone I fell in love with was the S2 and it was absolute magic. Note 3 was a close second. Since then I've had the S7 and S8 plus. I enjoyed them, but I didn't love them. 

The Note 9 is the first device I love in a long time. It's so darn good. The S-pen is fantastic. The battery life is long. Camera is great, especially with the new update. The speakers are powerful. I compared them to my girlfriends iphone XS and they sounded tinny in comparison. And it's just so *darned smooth*. That's what I've been missing for a long time. Super slick, no laggy touchwiz animations.

The only drawback is the price. But like Warren Buffett said the other day *""Smartphones are ridiculously underpriced considering the value and utility we get.""* 

That really got me thinking. I'm able to conduct 50-60% of my business, entertainment and connectivity through one device. It really is worth the price tag, to me at least.

samsung,88,2018-05-31 17:39:00,Dr_Nic_T61,[Other] Are you sick of ads on your Samsung TV?,"We need to raise all hell to get samsung to fix this. I've contacted news outlets, filed BBB complaints, along with my state attorney general, and so far samsung's responses have been a big ""f you""

On every smart television they manufacture, there are adverts displayed in the main UI of the TV's interface. This is not configurable, this is not something users can turn off or opt-out of, this is a permanent ""feature"" of the tv. 

A massive count of users have taken to the samsung forums, reddit, social media, and other platforms to express their concern over having no control of their hardware. The adverts are distracting, mess up how you use the TV by creating inconsistent UI, sometimes inappropriate for younger family members, and provide us absolutely no benefit. Samsung has responded to users by stating they would push an update out to fix this. This claim has been made by Samsung's twitter responses to social media complaints, and the mega thread on samsung's forum regarding this lack of control over adverts displaying. Samsung had also claimed the ads were not coming from their platform, but in fact they were coming from applications that were installed. Users attempted to unisntall every application, but you are not allowed to uninstall all of them. In addition, users are also getting ads for brand new Samsung TVs, myself I've gotten an ad for a new OLED samsung TV, on my brand new $3,000 Samsung Frame TV. It's been more than a year since these claims by samsung to fix it were made, and we are still stuck with nothing. Users have found workarounds to prevent the ads, however samsung has pushed firmware updates that made the ads come back.

I filed a complaint with the BBB, gave them all the details, and was shortly after contacted by a Samsung representative at the ""Office of the President"", Amber H. She stated that the terms I agreed to when setting up the TV allow Samsung to do whatever the hell they want on my TV. This was an interesting point since I explicitly did NOT agree to any terms when setting up my TV. I refused any terms, and wanted to use the TV as a dumb input device. Even then, I still got ads in the main UI. Amber told me despite what every user wished for, they would not make fixes to the products. I adamantly expressed dissatisfaction with the product, the negative impact the ads had, and the lack of control over the hardware I rightfully owned, and she told us we agreed to this. I saw nowhere in any of Samsung's product listings that you were opted-in to ads on your TV, and you had no way to disable them. This was an undisclosed ""feature."" After Amber and I going back and forth, the BBB complaint was unsatisfactorily closed. I was not done, so I contacted my state attorney general to escalate this. I notified Amber that I forwarded our conversation to my attorney general, and she condescendingly advised me that nothing would change. 

Samsung has made empty promises, directly lied, and misrepresents the products they sell. Then they refuse to make you happy after you've made your purchase, and continue to cash in on the ads they serve on their smart TV platform. Why the hell do they need more cash when my TV was $3

Samsung needs to be corrected and fix their products before the precedence is set that users get no control over their hardware and are force fed ads.

&#x200B;

I had an issue with my S10 + (which I had pre-ordered) so I requested an exchange, instead the lady put in a return for refund meaning that I lost the Galaxy Buds Pre-order bonus. 

&#x200B;

The issue with their support is that the staff have a basic understanding of english and literally follow a script, the second the query goes off script they have no idea what to do and are unable to problem solve. A manager offered a £10 voucher towards the galaxy buds which is ridiculous considering that I would have got them for free with my phone. 

Another big excuse they use is ""we need to transfer you to someone else who is not available so let's schedule a callback""... 3 days later no callback.

&#x200B;

Samsung seriously you are really letting yourselves down, all you need to do is get support representatives that can speak the local language AND problem solve.

1. My Galaxy S8+ has Bixby, and Google Assistant. Sometimes having both of them able to access different things on each side.
2. My Gear S3 has S Voice, and no ability to access the assistants on the phone, despite being connected to it.
3. The IconX have the workout assistant, but also need to connect to the phone for Bixby requests.
4. My Galaxy Tab 10.5 has a deprecated version of S Voice, with no support for it, so also a different voice.

All of these things, when they are Android, have the latest Google Assistant. Normal, it's web queries. But Samsung version of on-board non-up-to-date line of assistants is a complete mess, with 4 different sounding voices. I really wish they would either dust it off, make all of them online or pass on to the Google one.",https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/a1r2n7/way_too_many_assistants/

samsung,75,2019-03-22 15:02:08,cursed_widow_main,How to Get the Best Out of Your Galaxy Buds,"Hey guys! I've heard a lot of people have volume issues on their buds, or are wondering how to get the best sound out of their buds. So here's a few tips/steps to ensure you're getting the most out of these buds.

First of all, upon pairing, change the press and hold action on the touchpad to be volume up and down. Press and hold on the right bud until you hear a double beep. The double beep let's you know that the Buds' volume is all the way up. This allows you to get the most volume from your buds. The volume on the phone is separate from the volume if the buds themselves.

Secondly, turn the EQ on in the Galaxy Wearables app and make sure it's on dynamic. This makes the sound quality really pop!

Third, go into the phone's settings. Go to Sounds and Vibration. Scroll all the way down to Advanced Sound Settings. Tap on that, then tap on Sound Quality and Effects. From here, you can turn on Dolby Atmos (which I highly reccomend) you can select music or movie, depending on what you'll be listening to at that moment. Just hold down on the Dolby atmos box and it'll take you to that second menu. 

Fourth, STAY IN SOUND QUALITY AND EFFECTS. I keep my EQ in settings at Normal, but feel free to play around with it. Scroll to the bottom of the sound quality and effects menu and select Adapt Sound. You can pick whichever one fits your age profile, but I HIGHLY recommend adding your own personalized sound profile. This plays beeps in each ear, and tunes everything depending on if you can hear the beep or not. This makes the buds sound much better since they will be personalized to your ears. 

Lastly, go to Developer Options. Under the networking category you will see bluetooth streaming options. Change bluetooth AVRCP version to 1.6. Then go to Bluetooth audio LDAC codec: playback quality. Set it to optimized for audio quality.


And that's it! Hopefully you guys can definitely hear the difference. Enjoy!

EDIT: Forgot to add that the codec should be switched to AAC",https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/b463f9/how_to_get_the_best_out_of_your_galaxy_buds/

samsung,65,2019-03-10 01:13:09,subwaycom,Very impressed with my S10. Don't think I'll be going back to iPhone for a long while.,"Now I've owned various flagship Android phones and iPhones in the past, but I gotta say that Samsung really nailed it with the S10. It definitely does feel like a beautiful refinement of 10 years worth of smartphones.

Of course I can talk about the hardware, where Samsung has always prided itself in offering the most complete hardware experience. Best display on the market, headphone jack, expandable storage. And with the S10, adding a wide angle camera, there is so much potential with Samsung's hardware features.

But of course, one of the most standout features of Apple devices and where a lot of people (myself included) pick Apple over Android is the software experience. I think one of the biggest issues with Samsung phones has been the software. This is where I always give big props to Apple for having extremely intuitive, simple, thoughtful, polished software. However, with One UI, I feel this is the year where Samsung can really compete with iOS. Everything is smooth and clean. I think it strikes an excellent balance between simplicity and features - simple interface out the box for those who just want things to work, but also retains an abundance of features for users who want more control/personalisation. The settings app alone just feels like a breath of fresh air compared to the clutter of previous Samsung offerings.

That being said, there are things I dislike about the S10. The ultrasonic fingerprint sensor, while cool in theory, just fails in reliability for me. Believe me, I've watched countless videos, posted on various forums, rescanning fingerprints (with and without the screen protector on), various finger taps, holds, presses and it just doesn't work great, even after the software updates. I dislike that it is difficult to find a glass screen protector for the phone without having to pay for the expensive Whitestone Dome.

That aside, the only thing Samsung needs to continue to work on is the ecosystem. Having used a Note 9 and Galaxy Watch, and iPhone, Apple Watch, MacBook, there needs to be closer integration between Samsung devices. Apple adds lots of neat little flourishes like unlocking a MacBook with an Apple Watch in close proximity, or Handoff to continue work you started on your MacBook on your iPhone, or quickly sharing a hotspot with another iOS user without having to type out the long password. Just little quality of life improvements that really add to the experience.

If Samsung can continue to work on these issues, I feel like their products can be even more alluring. Apple has been making some questionable decisions in the last few years with their removal of features, form over function, nickel and diming, controversial hardware changes, incremental generational improvements while charging higher and higher prices. Apple have become incredibly safe wth their recent decisions and may be taking their previous successes and customer loyalty for granted. Samsung needs to capitalise on this and come out with a more compelling ecosystem to really give the competition a big kick up the rear.

There was a time where I wouldn't have minded paying a premium for an iPhone, but with the omission of the headphone jack, fast charger, headphone adapter all while charging a high price how could somebody not be offended by how Apple is treating their customers? They're caring more about how they can sell you a $9 headphone adaptor or the $159 AirPods, when really those two things should be included in the $999+ price tag. Samsung gives you all those features while bundling in a free pair of Galaxy Buds with S10 preorders. I know this is probably part of the honeymoon phase but unless Apple can start making some radical changes to the iPhone line, I don't think I'll be going back to iPhone for a while and will stick with Samsung for my smartphone of choice.

**TL;DR: Samsung is getting much closer to Apple in terms of offering a good software experience with the S10, while retaining feature-packed hardware. Apple needs to make some radical changes with their iPhone line or they will turn off customers with constant price hiking, controversial hardware changes and lack of compelling new features compared to the competition.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/azai4b/very_impressed_with_my_s10_dont_think_ill_be/

I said ""No, but I have an adapter. Then she said, ""What?"" in a confused manner. I replied, ""Nevermind, about a charger. I forgot I could this thing with my phone that can charge other people's phones (Wireless PowerShare)."" As I started up Wireless PowerShare on my S10+, she asked, ""What do I do now?"" And I said, ""Just place your phone on top of mine."" As she placed her iPhone on top of the back of my S10+, I noticed that her phone was at 1% and as her phone vibrated to notify her that her phone was charging; she thought it was so cool. After like 10-15 minutes of charging her phone to 15%, she said thanks and after class she was so amazed that she is now thinking of switching from iPhone to Samsung.

TL;DR: I charged my classmate's iPhone with Wireless PowerShare on my S10+, and she was wowed by the feature that she is now thinking of getting a Samsung.

My thoughts: I think that it is so cool that the Wireless PowerShare function bridges the gap of charging other phones than Samsung that are compatible with Wireless Charging, such as iPhone.

Had the phone for 2 days now and I'm honestly stunned. I paid $500usd for a phone that is faster, more memory, bigger screen, lighter, upgradeable, customizable, more storage than an iPhone xs max.
I just watched a 4k video with this Dolby atmos thing I swear to god it is some black magic. My phone has surround sound...

Everything is plenty intuitive enough nothing has been hard about the switch, if I do find myself fumbling I use the search function. I'm constantly finding something new that it does and silently go ""whaaaaaaat?"" To myself... my wife makes fun of me every chance she gets because I've talked SOOO much shit about android and Samsung's to her in the past. She has had a Samsung for just as long as I've had an iphone.

All in all, I'm so happy with my phone, it's much cheaper and just better in nearly every single way. We actually bought my wife one too because they gave us $600 trade in for her note 8. Just crazy.

I didn't want to wait for what they said would be at least 2 weeks wait and I'm not complaining, first time with a Samsung device and it definitely lives up to the hype for me. 

Been within the Apple ecosystem forever and it's a little daunting leaving it at first, but after half a day with the phone and figuring out life without iCloud and everything it brings, I can say I really like what this phone has to offer. I'm coming from the iPhone XS Max and I do miss the simplicity of iOS, but not the limitations.

Is it literally just a voice function or is there something else to it? Why does it need this weird homepage that wants my apps to start posting in ? Isn't that the point of having apps on the home screen  ?

Why do I need this additional button for it, when if I wanted to use it, for the voice feature, you should just say :hi Bixby"". It's annoyingly too close to the sound buttons.

What is with the retarded levelling up system ? I've bought an expensive phone, yet I'm being pushed to use this system, and can't change colours of the screen without levelling up?

It doesn't work well, it's intrusive, I can't get rid of it easily without having to mess about following online guides and downloading alternative apps, it's trying to manipulate me into using it with a levelling system. 

All I want is a reliable way of doing voice commands, I don't understand why Bixby frames itself as so much more, unless I am missing something ?

samsung,54,2019-03-04 19:27:25,sparkymat,Can we please stop mindlessly hating the bixby button?,"At 1:30 today bixby reminded me of my appointment in the city.  I pressed my bixby button and had bixby navigate me to an available parking lot.  Pressed the Bixby button ""save my parking"", got to my meeting, showed a friend ""show me pictures of my dogs"" 

I use it so much now its honestly one of the reasons im glued to samsung and just preordered s10+

Seconds matter, I dont want to say ""ok bixby"" 3 times, wonder if it heard me, stare at the screen, wait for the prompt that its finally ready for me to talk....I doubt I would even use it anymore.  I never use google for that reason except when I'm clicking the microphone on the search bar, or rarely holding the home button.

I never hit the button accidentally (maybe when the phone was a week old years ago)

Bixby does everything I need and the button makes it very easy for me.  Every time I watch a YouTube video that talks about how horrible Bixby is in the hope they'll remove the button in the next phone I cringe.

Are people even trying to use it? I feel like the hate is just a meme.

samsung,51,2018-12-06 17:13:47,yaaanR,Let me tell ya'll about my washer refund experience. It has been a trip.,"So I bought a top loading Samsung Washer like 3 years ago when I bought my house.  It had a recall on it where you could either get bought out of your unit or get it repaired with an extended warranty.  I chose to get it repaired as that seemed easier at the time.  After the repair, either because of it or incidentally, the washer started having consistent errors with unbalancing, and probably without us knowing about it wasted a ton of water because it would try to self-repair the unbalance by refilling the load with water.  Once we noticed how pervasive of an issue this was, we requested a repair under warranty.  A technician from Dish network, which I'm assuming is just who services Samsungs in my area, came out twice, seemed to do a diligent job, but was unable to repair.  They tried to order additional parts to resolve it, but Samsung cancelled that repair, and said they were going to process a refund for us.  Since then, they have closed my ticket at least 4 times, despite me confirming that I've sent over all necessary documentation, which included cutting the cord off my washer and removing the serial number stickers and sending a bill of purchase from Home Depot.  I have literally called Samsung 10 times since then, and have yet to actually hear from a refund specialist or whoever the fuck I need to talk to to just get a check cut for the refund.  I've already purchased a new Samsung washer, and felt at first like this whole thing was working out in our favor and that Samsung had treated us very fairly, and now a month later I can't figure out how any company's customer service can be this haphazard and disorganized, and feel like I'm being forced to fight tooth and nail for a refund that I was promised and that forced me to make my already poorly running washer completely inoperable by cutting the power cord.  /endrant",https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/a3pxo5/let_me_tell_yall_about_my_washer_refund/

For me, it's great to admire the aesthetic beauty of the device while I'm unboxing and setting things up, but after that, it's right into a case so that it stays unbroken.  

I'm wondering, how many of you use your device without a case, and how long does that last?  Even if you're not clumsy, the act of swiping is constantly pushing the device away from you and out of your hand ... always putting things at risk of falling and breaking.

samsung,45,2019-03-05 20:52:48,AsleepOnTheTrain,Samsung Trade-In Is a Scam. My Story - A Cautionary Tale,"In early October 2018, Samsung ran a ""double your trade in value"" promotion, offering $600 in trade-in value for the S9+ when buying the Note 9.

Unfortunately, I ignored the warnings from all of those people who had issues with Samsung trade-ins and participated in that promotion. 

Today marks the end of a 5-month journey to get proper credit for my Samsung trade-in.


Here is my story.

* October 11, 2018 - I purchased the Note 9.

* October 18, 2018 - I sent my S9+ to Samsung.  It was in prestine condition, only a couple of months old and in a RhinoShield/Whitestone Dome combo since purchase.  
Due to the experiences others had, I very thoroughly photographed the phone as I packed it for shipping to make sure there would be no issues.

* November 16, 2018 - I get an email from Samsung - ""Great news, your trade-in value estimate is $50.""

* November 16, 2018 - I call Samsung and ask why it was $50 and not $600.  I was told the phone was not in good enough condition to receive $600.  
I inform them it was in perfect condition, and I have photos to prove it.  I ask them to escalate this issue and they said I will receive a call back.

* November 30, 2018 - After 2 weeks of silence, I file a complaint with the BBB of New Jersey, including a link to my photos of the phone.

* December 4, 2018 - I receive an email from the Samsung Office of the President.  They ask for my order number from Samsung.  I tell them I purchased from Costco.  
They reply, ""Unfortunately we are the office of president for Samsung.com and at this time since you did not purchase your device from us we are unable to provide you with the promotion that you are inquiring about.""  
Purchasing the phone from Samsung was not a requirement for this promotion.

* December 14, 2018 - Samsung replies to my BBB complaint saying that I did not send them an S9+, but instead sent an S5 (which obviously, is not the case).

* December 14, 2018 - I reject their response (BBB asks you to accept/reject the business response within 10 days).

* December 24, 2018 - Samsung responds, saying the case has been escalated and upper management will notify my when there is a conclusion.

* January 14, 2019 - Still nothing from Samsung. I receive a call from BBB saying that this is not uncommon, and they will get their arbitrator involved.

* January 23, 2019 - Samsung responds, stating, ""PrizeLogics has also advised that $550.00 Virtual VISA card is being processed today, 1/23/19 and the new Virtual VISA will be emailed within the next few days.""

* January 31, 2019 - I reject their response, since I still had not received the $550. ($50 from the original email from them + $550 = $600 promo total.)

* February 8, 2019 - Samsung responds, ""The Promotions team has advised that the $550.00 Virtual Visa was approved in their system on 1/23/2019 however it is still waiting to be synced in with their OmniCard account.  This usually takes a couple weeks to sync and unfortunately at this time, the Promotions team is waiting for OmniCard to approve the submission and issue the Virtual Visa.""

* February 22, 2019 - I reject their response because I still had not received anything from them.

* March 4, 2019 - Samsung responds, ""The Promotions team has provided the below link to be able to access the $550.00 Virtual Visa code.""  Finally it's over.

TL;DR Samsung tried to avoid honoring their trade-in promotion, BBB and an arbitrator had to get involved.

1. By saying the phone was in bad condition (it was perfect)

2. Because I didn't buy it from them (irrelevant to the promotion)

3. By saying I sent in an S5 and not an S9+ (clearly not the case)

4. By stalling until I gave up (for over 2 months)

samsung,45,2018-08-28 14:27:46,,Note 9 vs Galaxy S9 Plus,"Forgive me if this is frequently asked.. didn't see anything on the front page.

Between the Note 9 and the S9 Plus, which should I get? I don't see any technology differences at all beyond the S-Pen, which to be honest I will never use. Both are attractive phones and I am ultimately getting one of the two, to ditch my iPhone.

I text, check my emails, and would run an emulator like Retroarch for some games. Pretty basic user.

Any advice either way is appreciated.",https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/9azdks/note_9_vs_galaxy_s9_plus/

samsung,44,2019-04-01 10:21:47,Serjical_Strike,Samsung Galaxy Buds... exceeded my expectations!,"Since I got my S10 Plus I've been thinking of getting the Galaxy Buds but looking at reviews, some positive, some negative and coming from wearing an over ear pair of AKG -K550's (also amazing) at work all day I didn't expect much sound wise and merely wanted the wireless capability. I was ready to take the hit to sound quality for the freedom but my god... these things sound amazing. 

After some playing around with the wingtips and ear bud tips to find the best fitting and seal I pressed play on 'Deutschland' and was blown away with how clear it was on the default setting. Good bass without needing the bass boost. The other settings... not so good but that 'Dynamic' setting works beautifully. Find the right combo of wing and tip and boom.

Setting the long press to Google Assistant also lets me perform actions on the phone or call without needing to take my phone out.

Overall, super impressed and glad I didnt put the purchase off even longer. For anyone on the fence... get off it.

Anyone else got any tips or enjoying them?

samsung,43,2019-02-20 01:22:43,SwordOfTruthHurts,Android Pie Sucks,"Reasons why it sucks:

- App list is like iPhones now. One of the reasons I got a Samsung phone is because I preferred the stacked multi view of apps that made it faster to quit apps I wasn't using

- It uses more battery 

- It looks like it was simultaneously made for 8 year olds and people above 60.

- The text is too large and makes me feel like a grandpa

- They removed performance mode from the notification menu

- The notification menu looks horrid. Buttons are too big and what's worh the huge space on top for time and date? Uneccesary and inefficient.

- Why would you move the clock to the left side? WHY? Do they even know why they made half the changes they did??

- I can no longer hide the bottom button bar. Sure I can hide the ugly button redesign they did and have three vertical lines instead, but now when I'm using say spotify, I still have a thin, obtrusive white bar at the bottom to contrast against a dark themed app. Brilliant.

- They dumbed it down. Yes, Oreo had a learning curve, but the benefit outweighed the cost. Now everything has been made ""easier"" and thusly less useful and efficient. Again... Brilliant... 

- In multi view I can't hit the background to exit the view 

- Noticeable animation lag when closing and opening apps.

- EVERYTHING is spaced out way too much. I feel like I'm back on an iPhone. EW.

Now I have to spend my time figuring out how to recert back to Oreo. Had I known the update was going to be a huge UI update I would have made a backup, but alas, I trusted Samsung updates since I never disliked any updates in the past.

The Samsung forums is pretty much a hate group about the new update right now:

I placed my pre-order on the 12th.  Prior to placing my order, I contacted Samsung's customer support via chat.  I asked if they could guarantee delivery by the 24th, which the representative agreed to.  I even asked to speak to a manager to make sure this employee had the knowledge and authority to make such a guarantee, and the manager backed the statement 100%.  I had them email it to me from the company so I would have it in writing.

Today, I received an email from Samsung saying my Note 9 won't be shipped until September 2nd.  I contacted customer support, asking why my phone was delayed considering my reservation as well as pre-order, and was repeatedly told they could not provide me any information, that I had to wait until it was shipped then talk to fedex.

Now, they won't let me cancel my order.  I keep asking who do I contact, who do I email, how do I get refunded for the tax I paid, but nothing.  They refuse to give me a response, they refuse to answer my question, they refuse to answer my email.

Honestly, I normally wouldn't care about waiting an extra couple of weeks for a phone.  But every single interaction I've ever had with Samsung, I've gotten screwed in.  I ordered the note 7, loved it, but was forced to return it.  I was forced into signing a new 2 year contract on a phone I didn't want, meaning I couldn't use the discount for the Note 8.  I love the specs and design of this new phone, but I'm just scared that Samsung isn't worth the trouble as a company.

samsung,36,2019-03-10 20:52:59,cm1234,"I've had my Galaxy S10e for 48 hours now, I would like to share my experience of moving from iOS to Android.","Happy Sunday /r/samsung, 

I would like to share my experience of using Android for the first time since 2012. My apologies for writing an entire book. I wanted to write a post like this to help other new Android users who may find this information helpful.  

I've divided my post into 4 sections: 

* Pre-ordering from Samsung
* Setting up Android
* Replacing iOS apps with Android apps
* TL;DR

I know there are many new and returning Android users like me who are leaving Apple's walled garden. The last time I used Android was 2012 when I had the Galaxy S3. The poor battery life and awful user experience at the time turned me off.

7 years later, the S10e (and the Lumia 1020) are the only non-Apple phones that stand out to me. In my opinion,, the S10e is a better device than the iPhone XS. I have a 2017 Macbook Pro and a Nintendo Switch, so having everything USB-C makes traveling less complicated. 


**Pre-Ordering from Samsung vs Apple**

Pre-ordering from Samsung was not a smooth experience. They cancelled my order for not being able to ""verify"" my debit card, despite successfully charging my card for the wireless charging stand and IconX. I ended up pre-ordering from BestBuy and I picked it up on Friday morning (3/8) without problems. 

Shopping at Apple is a better user experience and I've never had issues. Their customer service is way better than Samsung. 

Please step up your CS game, Samsung! 

**Setting up Android**

Setting up my S10e was pretty straight-forward. I'm a power-user. Once I finished the set up process, I went straight to settings to check for system updates, disable Facebook and turn off options that will maximize the battery life. After fully charging the S10e on Friday evening (3/8), I took it off the charging stand on Saturday morning (3/9). It's now Sunday morning (3/10) and my battery is at 53%. Between Saturday morning till now I've been: downloading and updating apps, playing games, browsing Reddit and logging into my accounts. *The battery life is fucking amazing.*

In terms of facial recognition for phone unlock, the iPhone XS and S10e are equally fast. However a [recent article](https://www.androidpolice.com/2019/03/09/samsung-galaxy-s10-face-unlock-can-be-fooled-by-a-photo-video-or-even-your-sister/) on /r/android mentioned that the S10e is not as secure as Face ID... so use the face unlock feature at your risk. 

There is no fingerprint sensor (or headphone jack) on the iPhone XS. Thank you Samsung for keeping it.

**From the iOS App Store to Google Play**

Just to be clear, I am NOT recommending apps for new users. I am only recommending apps that replaces what I use on my iPhone. This information stems from /r/Android and /r/androidapps posts from 1 year back.

* **Spotify** - I was using Apple music. Spotify is a thousand times easier to manage than Apple music. The issue with Apple music is that their design language is heavily rooted in iTunes, so doing things like adding artist to library was frustrating at times. 

* **Poweamp Music Player** - There are artists who aren't accessible on Spotify due to regional licensing. Before music streaming was a thing, I would need to use iTunes to transfer music from my computer to my iPhone. PowerAmp fills that need for me. I picked this over BlackPlayer EX because Poweramp's equalizer has more range. 

* **MX Player Pro** - This app replaces VLC. There's a free version too but I like supporting developers. 

* **Gmail** - This is going to sound embarrassing, but I've been using iCloud as my only email since 2014. I created a fresh new Google account when I got my S10e and Gmail blows iCloud mail out of the sky. Gmail is simply superior. This is not an opinion, this is an objective truth. Everything is just faster and better when using Gmail on chrome compared to iCloud on Safari. 

* **Google Photos** - I'm a casual photographer and all my photos have HUGE file sizes. I also like to keep my photos in their original quality, so I opted for additional storage. I don't see major differences between iCloud photos and Google photos, but then again I'm only using it store photos so maybe I'm missing out on something amazing...

* **Google Drive** - Good bye iCloud, hello Google Drive. I paid $2.99 USD for 200GB additional storage. This is cheaper than Apple where the lowest choice is $0.99 for only 50GB. Also Apple's free storage for iCloud is only 5GB while Google Drive it's 15GB. C'mon Apple, 5GB is not enough in this day and age. 

* **Google Keep** - I love this app. It's so fast to set up a note and it's intuitive to use. I am using Keep to replace my notes from Apple's notes app.

* **Find Device** - It works and has the same features as Apple's Find My Phone; you can beep your phone remotely and erase everything.

* **Samsung Pay** - I removed my debit card from Apple Pay and registered it with Samsung Pay. I do not plan on using Google pay. According to [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/GalaxyNote8/comments/96aq6t/samsung_pay_vs_google_pay/e3z9pka/), Samsung Pay does everything Google pay does and more. 

* **Play Games** - I'm a gamer and I want to talk about this for a little bit. In iOS, Game Center is used for achievements and iCloud is used to store game save files. In Android, Play Games is used for achievements AND saving games in the cloud. Play Games is a tiny bit better than Apple's implementation, as everything can be found in one app. 

This list is by no means complete. I'm still learning many new things about Android OS and One UI. If you can recommend a better app than the one's i've mention, please leave a comment to let everybody know! 

**TL;DR**

Android 9 is a fantastic OS. The user experience may feel alien for new users, and it will take time before I get used to doing things ""the Android way"". Android offers more flexibility and customization than iOS at it's current state. There is always substitute for every app.

I'm loving the S10e because of it's crazy battery life and usb-c port. I'll be holding onto this baby until foldable phones (or whatever the next big thing is) becomes mainstream.",https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/azkaex/ive_had_my_galaxy_s10e_for_48_hours_now_i_would/

Apple can’t do that for me anymore. 

There’s not many apps that don’t have android equivalents or better replacements I could get so this is not so much an issue to me. Anything I can’t get is really nothing I can’t live without as far as those go. I’m backing up my pictures to a computer and so that doesn’t concern me and I’ll just start taking new ones on the new phone, and my PDFs can easily be taken care of as they’re on my computer and all I used iBooks for anyway. 

It’s things like my contacts that I don’t know how to move over. Those are the most important thing to me. I could probably remember a few of the important numbers but never all of them and right now I keep them synced to iCloud so I don’t lose them. I have a Google account and know something like this probably exists on Android too but I’d just like to know how to do it and go about it.

The issue is that I have a HUGE reliance on iTunes. I have all of my music meticulously downloaded, organized, and stored on my computer from previously using CDs; I have around 3,000 songs. I’m very nervous about transitioning and finding a way to easily use my library on a Samsung. Some of my music is obscure recorded from vinyl so Spotify and other related services will not suffice.

Does anybody have any suggestions for this issue? I’d also appreciate any pointers or tips for transitioning in general.

samsung,34,2019-04-03 02:45:51,fuzemyhostage,One positive of the Galaxy Buds is that they are small enough you just forget about them. One negative is they are small enough to forget about them.,"RIP. Galaxy Buds. 2019-2019. Cause of death: Washing machine.



This is just a reminder to please always check your pockets before putting clothes in the wash.



Edit #1: It's been just under 48 hours since I washed these Buds. One thing I didn't mention before is that they were probably sitting in the washer for about 2 hours post-wash, which really gave me even less hope. However, I placed them into a mixture of rice and Rice-a-roni, because that's all I had on hand. I just took them out and placed them on my wireless charger, and [sure enough they are charging!](https://i.imgur.com/AeAAHwy.jpg). That's no guarantee that they will function perfectly, but it's something.

Edit #2: Charging over USB-C also appears to be working.

Edit #3: Aye, there's the rub. Although the left earbud came out of the wash at 95-100% capacity and the right came out at 5%, the right one is charging and the left one is not. In fact, the right one is working flawlessly as far as I can tell. It's hard to determine if the left one isn't charging because it's dead or because the case is fried on that side, and it's really hard to use the right side pins to charge the left bud. I already tried using wire and electrical tape to keep the pins down, but the pins have to be fully compressed for that to work and isn't something I'm capable of completing at this point. So the question becomes: do I try to buy a new charging case in the hope that this fixes the charging problem for the left bud, or just chalk this up to a freebie lost?",https://www.reddit.com/r/samsung/comments/b8sk9z/one_positive_of_the_galaxy_buds_is_that_they_are/

samsung,37,2019-03-05 05:16:49,Pottiland9,"All the changes coming to GoodLock Pie, March 8th 2019","Hi. As many of you are waiting for us, we will post the announcement to share your schedule. We are in the process of verification of stabilization for the final distribution, and if there is no big problem, we expect to open sequentially by task on March 8th. Looking forward to your long-awaited comments and the Galaxy Store star rating, we are developing with unlimited accountability and affection. In the next year, we will work on ways to prepare for a new OS upgrade with a little bit more time. We will share some improvements for you in advance.



1. Common: One UI applied. 


2. LockStar: Maintains the same function as the whole and provides some additional wallpapers. With the brick effect, Oreo assignments will be temporarily unavailable for use. 


3. QuickStar: Finally, the clock position adjustment is entered. (It is not possible to secure the area in the notch model.) It is possible to set Color Theme a little easier by automatic color extraction. 


4. Task changer We have prepared many new styles that many people will like. Pie's Google policy is part of the difficult part of entering the multi-window improvement. 


5. The basic functions of the routine are the same and will be opened to models other than S10. The S10 has been further enhanced with the design and features of the Vix non-routine. In order to do this, we will prepare the function to restore the existing routine data and will open it soon. 


6. One Hand Operation Task Switching is finally in. Provides the ability to turn off gestures for specific apps. It is a gesture that gradually gets closer to perfect. 


7. Select the Sound Assistant Basic Media app to make sure that the media key, such as a headset, is delivered. 


8. Nice Catch It is already in service. If you turn it on when it works on your phone, you can easily find out which app is the problem. 


9. You can use the multi-window convenience that you deleted in accordance with the Google policy while you are in multi-star pie. 


10. NavStar, Edge Lighting, Edge Touch Provides the same level of functionality as before. And this is a new function. (It is under development with the goal of opening at the end of March.) Thank you for your much anticipation. 1. NotiStar: It is a notification card management function for users who prefer the notification method on iPhone. 2. NiceShot: Provides useful options for capturing based on the various suggestions, and also provides tagging storage when capturing. Thank you once again for the customers who love us and wait for us. Even if there are a few problems in the early days after opening, we will try to make quick corrections if you give us affectionate feedback. All happy days and see you on March 8! o love us and wait for us. Even if there are a few problems in the early days after opening, we will try to make quick corrections if you give us affectionate feedback. All happy days and see you on March 8!

apple,4338,2018-10-20 10:45:00,Ipozya,"PSA : If two alarms go off at the same time (Alarm+calendar or alarm + bedtime wake-up), they cancel each other.","I discovered that the hard way. 

If you have, say an alarm for 8:00AM, and a reminder for an event at 9:00 set to « one hour before », the phone will only ring for a fraction of a second and then stop both alarms. 

The same goes for Bedtime. I had it set for 7:15 in bedtime, and forgot an alarm that was already set for 7:15. They cancelled each other after a split of a second. 

I will submit it to apple, but if more people do as well it is more likely to be fixed, and if someone doesn’t oversleep because of this post it will be a victory by itself !

(English isn’t my first language sorry if some wording sounds wrong)

As soon as we discovered it missing we called from my phone. The call was declined. By the time we opened up Find My iPhone, thief turned off the phone. 
She ended up having to buy a whole new phone. She is now making monthly payments for her new phone and the stolen phone.

Apple care doesn’t cover lost/stolen phones apparently. 
I thought that requiring the passcode to turn off the phone would be a good solution.

I'm that fella who built that [Apollo reddit app](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575) that some of y'all use!

Our local animal shelter (SPCA, similar to ASPCA in the states but Canadian) [is overflowing with kittens](https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/94vbs9/ns_spca_says_rooms_are_overflowing_with_kittens/) thanks to kitten season (warm weather means kittens breed a lot) and running low on food so I wanted to make a donation but figured the Apple/Reddit community is a great generous bunch so I wanted to use that to maybe raise some more money for the shelter, so 100% of Apollo's proceeds today are going to the shelter to get them food and supplies!

So if you've been interested in Apollo at all (free download) and held off on getting Apollo Pro (costs a few bucks) today's a great opportunity to do so and help out some kitties and puppies! I got my little one from there this time last year ([her name is Ruby](https://i.imgur.com/aHKZv2E.jpg)) and she's a delight so I can personally attest that they're an awesome bunch.

So yeah! Your support would be greatly appreciated, (or you can [donate directly](https://46189.thankyou4caring.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=298) or even just donate to your local shelter it all helps!).

If you already have Pro there's a ""Tip Jar"" in the Settings tab where you can donate further too, and I'll donate 100% of that too!

I'll post how much we raised and proof of donation tomorrow!

apple,1857,2019-02-24 18:10:29,_alex87,"With new OLED iPhones, I wish Apple would allow front LED notification lights...","So anyone who's had a blackberry or older android devices knows what I'm talking about... the cool little LED light on the front of the phone that would light up when the phone was locked to nonchalantly let you know you had a new text, email, missed call, etc. 

Unfortunately, iPhones never had this feature. HOWEVER, something that I find interesting with new OLED displays is quite interesting, and I wonder if Apple would ever consider doing it.

Since the new iPhones with OLED displays can activate only certain pixels on the display (so if the screen is black, it can turn on certain pixels; this is how Android phones use this for the ""Always-On"" display where it shows the date and time). 

Why can't Apple use this technology and put it to the left or right of the notch just making a little glowing light pop up while the phone is locked to allow us to see if we have a waiting notification?

I think it's a really cool and convenient idea. It doesn't require an actual LED light to be built into the phone, it just uses the pixels in a dot-like figure in the notification bar area to just glow. It may not be as bright as a real LED, but it's a pretty cool feature. And all it would take is an iOS update. 

Would anyone care for this? I would. I miss those LED notification lights so much. It's very useful IMO. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/auamf7/with_new_oled_iphones_i_wish_apple_would_allow/

Long story short yesterday [I made a post here](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/953nqz/i_built_the_apollo_reddit_client_and_im_donating/) saying I'll donate all the proceeds from my Apollo Reddit client for the day to our local SPCA animal shelter (an awesome Canadian non-profit, no-kill shelter) because they said they were really low on supplies and well cats and dogs are awesome and need our help. I wanted to make a donation but I figured the awesome Apple/Reddit community might want to get in on that and give them something for it in the process so I made a post about it and sweet mayonnaise did you guys ever.

$5,087.23 is the total amount raised. Yeah seriously I'm not joking, I wanted to raise like a few hundred bucks but 5 freaking grand is just absurdly beyond what I thought. All the amounts below are in Canadian dollars at today's exchange rate because most things came in in US dollars and it's a Canadian charity.

### Breakdown

- $4,038.55 in proceeds from Apollo sales. 
- $500 ($653.16 CAD) approximately from a ton of [direct donations](https://46189.thankyou4caring.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=298), hard to keep track but going off of a general tally from the comments and PMs I received I can honestly say I think that's undershooting the amount donated directly if anything 
- $50 worth of bitcoin donated ($65.31 CAD)
- $25 from a kind friend
- Someone awesomely gave me Reddit gold so I'll donate that too ($5.21 CAD)

That brings the total to approximately $4,787.23 but I really wanted that over $5,000 (plus there's some still some people commenting here and there about donating through Apollo even though the day's over and I want their money to count) I'll throw in another $300 of my own for a clean total of $5,087.23.

### Proof

As I stated around $500 ($653.16 CAD) of that total was donated directly to the charity (not through Apollo) from some amazing people so they already have those funds awesomely, so the amount remaining is $5,087.23 - $653.16 which is $4,434.07.

I wanted to try to figure out the best way to donate that, so I [posted asking](https://www.reddit.com/r/halifax/comments/95c0cs/if_i_theoretically_had_about_5000_to_donate_to/) and then called their fundraising line to make sure and they said it would be best to donate it directly, which makes a lot of sense.

Of course it would have been cool to throw open the doors of the shelter with $5,000 worth of pet food and music playing but the goal is the animals (and not to be flashy) and fact is they can do a lot more with that money directly than through one of us buying stuff (bulk supply discounts, they can put it exactly where needed, etc.) so I donated it directly per their advice and now they can do the best possible things with it to help out the kitties and puppies and turtles and rabbits and whatnot of Nova Scotia. :)

- Proof 1 from online form: https://i.imgur.com/katRyYv.png
- Proof 2 from confirmation email: https://i.imgur.com/VWy46Ja.png
- Proof 3 from bank account: https://i.imgur.com/sa7L7r7.png
- Proof 4 from thank you email from them (wow!): https://i.imgur.com/WcGmh7Y.png

If you need more proof and can think of a way to provide it please just say so.

### Pics

A bunch of people were curious to see pics of the animals in need so we stopped over on my girlfriend's lunch break and took some pics for y'all. It's the same shelter [we got both of our cute fuzzballs from too](https://i.imgur.com/IaZqLDm.jpg).

Here's an album of a bunch of the pics (it was really hot out so I couldn't take any of the dogs out for a walk to take some pics they're really cute and I took a pic of the adoption board): 

Album of cute animals animals at the shelter: https://imgur.com/a/kYEoI5y

Video of one kitty getting head scratches: https://streamable.com/t3y5t

### Thank You

Seriously everyone thank you so much. It honestly blew me away, I was hoping for a small something but I really think this is going to make a massive difference to a lot of needy animals, y'all are the best. And if anyone missed the chance yesterday and still want to you can donate directly to them here: https://46189.thankyou4caring.org/sslpage.aspx?pid=298 Or even just to your local shelter, they surely need the help as well! My two little furballs thank you too.

Definitely won't be the last time I do this with Apollo, I'll try to do something like this again someday since it went so well. :D Anyway, back to work (and obligatory if you wanna check out a cool Reddit app check out [Apollo](https://itunes.apple.com/app/id979274575)!)

If you have any questions or anything too I'm happy to answer.

I always sell my devices to upgrade to the latest and greatest. Between 2006 and 2015 when I got the 6S, I had 12 phones - an average of one every 9 months. 

But honestly, I haven’t had a reason to upgrade from the 6S. I had always heard about how long iPhones were supported (for better or worse) but I never thought after 3 years I’d have a phone on the latest OS performing exactly the same as the day I got it.  Even getting one years worth of updates is pushing it in the majority of the Android world. I had a few month low point after iOS 11 was released where I was getting awful lags, but that is long gone now. 

No wonder Apple still sells the 6S and SE. This hardware seems to be rock solid futureproof. Other than the shiny newness of the iPhone X interface, I don’t have a legitimate compelling reason to upgrade anytime soon.

apple,1055,2019-03-13 15:50:00,diggwasmuchbetter,The grass wasn't greener on the other side. My brief affair with the s10+,"Since this is reddit, I need to specify that these are my own opinions and experiences. They could be completely different for someone else. Also, I realize objectively speaking, the s10+ is a great phone and lots of people love Android. That's awesome and I'm happy for those people.

As far as the s10+ goes, the hardware is decent but not great. Software is not good. I've had one since they launched and I'm actually returning it today to go back to the iPhone.

Hardware has one major issue and that is the touch implementation with the curved display. I have tons of accidental touches that make the phone almost unusable when holding it with one hand (yes I tried downloading multiple apps to fix this issue. I shouldn't have to download apps to make the phone usable though.). The sides are also not completely round or completely squared. It's not the most comfortable phone to hold. This is purely a strange thing that comes down to me as an individual but for some odd reason the s10+ feels lighter than my iPhone X. It's not...but it feels like it. I prefer the heavier more solid feel of the iPhone X. I was really looking forward to the finger print reader, but it's a let down. It works maybe 85% of the time for me and that's not really acceptable in my opinion. Also, yes I have done multiple things to improve the fp reader. Those changes did help improve it from about a 30% success rate so there's that. The screen is also nice but I personally don't see a major difference between the s10+ screen and the iPhone x screen. On the other hand I will say the headphone jack and the fast charging are amazing though. The fast charging is something I didn't know I wanted or needed. It's seriously legit.

The software (Android specifically) is great when it comes to the amount of customization that is possible. On the other hand, I don't enjoy having to download a variety of apps so I can get some of the same basic features of iOS. I also feel like the design language on iOS apps and iOS in general is much more standardized than Android and Android apps. Also, for some reason, I can't seem to type accurately at all on the keyboard. I have tons of misspelled words and there are annoyances like the first letter of a sentence not capitalizing all the time. Another issue is that sometimes touches on the screen aren't recognized. Not sure if that is hardware or software though. Also, one last thing, the scrolling on the s10+ was really bad. If I was scrolling down a webpage it was either super slow or super fast.

I'm going back to the AT&T store today to return the s10+. I might get an XS and I might stick with my X, but the one thing I know is that I am sticking with Apple.

apple,1038,2019-03-05 13:40:10,treboruk,For any iPhone XR doubters...,"I was an iPhone XR doubter. Unfortunately, my iPhone 8 was involved in a workplace accident and was squashed by a big printer (don't ask), so I ultimately had to replace it.

I went to the Apple store and weighed my options. To fix my out of warranty iPhone 8 would've roughly been half a new device, so I decided to buy a replacement. I wasn't going to buy the year old iPhone 8 again, so it was between the iPhone XR or XS. I wasn't going to blow £999 on the XS as I couldn't justify spending that much on a phone because of an accident, so I bought the XR. I was dreading the lack of 3D Touch and the dated display **for a 2018 device.**

It took some time to get used to the size and weight of the XR, but after 2 weeks of using it, I can safely say it is a fantastic device and is definitely an improvement over my iPhone 8 **in all areas.**

The only thing I miss is 3D Touch, especially 3D touching the keyboard **(I know I can long press the space bar on the XR, but it is no way near as reliable)** The display is very impressive for a sub 1080p LCD panel, and is definitely an improvement over the iPhone 8.

All in all - great device. I hope Apple work on improving 'Haptic Touch', as there are definitely a few functions of '3D Touch' that can be emulated with long touches. 


&nbsp;

*******************************************************************
*-edit- People seem to really want to know how my iPhone 8 met its maker, so here goes...*

I had to lift up one of those office desktop printers and relocate it somewhere else. This wasn't your typical HP home desktop printer though. This was one of the old school, super heavy Xerox multi-functional printers. It even has a notice on the back of it recommending 2 people lift it. Who even reads the small print?

I put my iPhone 8 (complete with case and glass screen protector) in my pocket, proceeded to pickup this anvil of a printer, and lugged it to the nearest lift. Went down a couple of floors, picked the damn thing up again, and finally got it where it needed to be.

Went back to my desk, got my phone out and it was completely smashed. Front screen & home button. The home button didn't even respond anymore! Complete fluke. I luckily work near an Apple store so I took it there and even they were miffed. It must've been from how I was holding the printer? 

I had one good bit of news that day though - apparently that printer got moved again by someone else, and they couldn't do it by themselves; they had to get someone else to help them. HA!

As a student i decided to sell my iPhone 8 and use the money to buy some other stuff. I bought an used 6S (battery capacity is %82 so i’ll change it as soon as i can). Touch ID is fast as fuck, it has 3D touch (i thought it came with 7) and the most surprising part to me is phone is at 11.4 and literally as fast as iPhone 8. I’m still surprised and impressed because my old phone before 8 was iPhone 5C and phone went to shit after each update lol. I was one of those people that’d always advise to never update the phone. If anyone is considering buying 6S in 2018, do it. It’s an amazing phone and besides camera (8 has the best camera i’ve ever seen in a phone but 6S is not bad, just normal if you compare them).

apple,834,2018-08-14 18:46:32,smackaroonial90,Fun Story about Recovering a Stolen iPhone,"A few years ago I was working at a phone store. I owned an iPhone 4s at the time, and had set my phone on the my desk/counter. The customer I was helping (let's call them Customer #1) wanted a new phone with service, so I went into the back to retrieve Customer #1's new phone and when I got back to the counter they had left. That wasn't a problem, I've had people leave without explanation before, I wasn't worried.

The next customer in line (Customer #2) asked a question about a feature on the iPhone, so I went to reach for my phone and realized it was gone. I started looking on, below, and behind the counter, and couldn't find it. Customer #2 was a frequent customer, and they told me to take my time. I called my iPhone from the store phone and couldn't hear it. Customer #2 was fascinated, he said he thought he saw Customer #1 reach over the counter and take it.

This was when I decided to log into iCloud and to ring it and see where it is. So I logged in, and saw the phone ping half way across the city. Customer #1 had taken it and was running. When I saw that he was running I immediately made sure the phone had a lock on it, and called it. He turned it off. I sent a message to it via iCloud saying ""I know you stole my phone, please return it to the store and I won't press charges"" so that when he turned it on again it would be the first thing that he would see. I got an email that he turned it on again at about 10 pm that night at an apartment complex. The cop that I had been talking to told me that unless there was only a single house in a 30-foot radius that they wouldn't be able to enter the residence. I was screwed.

They turned the phone off really fast when they saw the message that night. The next morning, I saw that they had turned the phone on again at the same location, so I assumed that Customer #1 lived there. The next message I sent was a little more specific, I sent something along the lines of ""Hi, This is your address XXX, I will send the police to your residence by this afternoon unless I get the phone back. Please bring the phone back to the store and I won't press charges.""

When Customer #1 saw this message I knew they panicked because they immediately turned the phone off and a few minutes later the phone pinged in an empty field about a mile away from their house and then turned off again. I thought my phone was toast. I went to the field that morning before work to see if I could find the phone. There was nothing. I left for work after looking around for a few minutes. When I got to work I noticed that there was a plastic bag by the front door. Could it be?

I went and grabbed the bag and lo and behold there was my phone inside it! It was very dusty, which I assumed was was from Customer #1 throwing the phone into the field, then realizing that I still had their address, and returned the phone to the store.  iCloud and findmyiphone saved me hundreds of dollars that day.

Edit:  TL;DR: My iPhone was stolen off the front counter at work and I traced it to the thief's home address and told him via my phone that I knew his address. He put the phone in a bag and left it outside my work the next day.",https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/97azxp/fun_story_about_recovering_a_stolen_iphone/

apple,758,2018-06-11 23:59:01,ThatGuyPhillip,Apple should introduce a free-trial period for iOS games,"Basically, you get a free-trial where you can try premium games/apps for a certain period set by the developers e.g. 1 day, 3 days or 1 week. 

Let's face it - people aren't willing to spend money on premium games. And I can understand why, as I've regretted spending money on premium games because it was different to what I expected, or I just didn't like it. 

Introducing a free-trial period would support premium games more as it would allow iOS users to know if the game is worth spending money on. 

It's a shame that iOS is littered with poor quality F2P games that have in-app purchases, a P2W mechanism, or an energy/time system. 

The loot-box rule (the one where new apps must now disclose odds of loot boxes) they introduced last year was a step in the right direction for iOS gaming. But that is not enough, we iOS players want more quality games. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/8qebnk/apple_should_introduce_a_freetrial_period_for_ios/

apple,718,2018-05-21 07:27:18,ILIJAC,Ringtones that will use the maximum potential of your speakers.,"Hey fellas!

Recently, I bought an iPhone X and felt like the speakers potential is not used enough. Or it is, but the factory content that is provided is somehow quiet for my needs. I'm a sound designer and a synth addict and I love loud space engines, powerful gunshots, 808, weird harmonics and chord progressions, so out of curiosity I decided to create some ringtones and obtain the loudness that the speakers can provide.

What I did was I tested the frequency range of the iPhone X speakers and designed sounds with a specific EQ and limiter that will match the exact maximum and needed power. To elaborate a bit, with a pink noise I checked the frequencies on which the X is distorting and leveled them with EQ, while boosting the other ones where the loudness is safer and can play louder frequencies.

All of the content is exclusive and free \(and loud\), and my idea is to release a bundles, depending on the creativity and inspiration.

So, head over to [https://ilijac.com/extras/](https://ilijac.com/extras/) and let me know what you think! :\) with the Reddit app, the page is zoomed in, you just have to zoom out and you can scroll over the content.

apple,655,2018-10-27 14:58:53,iamthatis,"Apollo 1.3 is now available! I added notifications (finally), details inside.","It's been almost exactly a year since I first posted here about Apollo, a little new Reddit app for iOS on the block, and you all really received it with open arms. Thanks for an absolutely amazing last year.

Today comes Apollo 1.3, the notifications update! It includes (you guessed it!) notifications as the core part of the update, which has probably been the most requested feature for Apollo. It took a long time to get right, but I'm super stoked with how it came out. They're fast, super battery efficient, and almost like a mini-app in themselves, as you can reply, upvote, downvote, view context, and more right from the notification, so you don't even have to open the app most of the time, you can do everything right from the notification in your lockscreen or when it drops down from the top. You can even customize the sound with a bunch of great options, like a turkey gobble or a penguin… scree? (There's normal noises too.)

One part to mention early is that the update includes the dreaded, hated, loathed subscriptions. But if you're not interested in notifications you can completely ignore them. Long story short, push notifications require a server (it's where they're ""pushed"" from), and servers have ongoing monthly costs. I really couldn't afford just to give it away with Pro, and I didn't want to move Pro to a subscription model, so I added an extra feature pack called ""Apollo Ultra"" that you can choose, that comes with some notifications and some extra things!

Now I'll copy-paste a little FAQ I made up that explains more, but I'm happy to answer further questions too if you have any! I'll chill in this thread.

### Apollo 1.3

Notifications have been notably absent from Apollo from the get-go, but it's been because they're a really hard thing to do, and to do right. Long story short, there's a few ways to do them. You can do it completely on device, but this affects device battery life, and causes substantial delays in delivery as it can only fetch so often. An option that fixes these downsides is to do all the work on an external server, which doesn't affect battery life, and results in instant delivery. [Here's a video of Scott Forstall talking about server advantages way back in iPhone OS 3.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M3fMDdmcsaU)

On top of all this, recent versions of iOS really also souped up the power of what notifications can do on the device, but weirdly a lot of apps don't take advantage of that (look at iMessage for an app that does, how you can view your messages and reply inline).

For Apollo, I really didn't want to cut corners, so I've spent the last few months building up a really awesome solution with a dedicated server to handle the notifications, as well as taking advantage of everything iOS has to offer for making notifications powerful. The result is Apollo notifications are super battery efficient, super fast, and crazy powerful. You can view an entire conversation's context from the notification, reply, upvote, downvote, and more without ever having to leave the lockscreen. You can even customize the sound of the notification, I like making it sound like a turkey gobble. It's like a mini-app in itself.

Now, to be completely up front with you, servers have ongoing, monthly costs. Yeah, there's no getting around that unfortunately. I'd love to just say ""here, everyone who has Pro gets notifications!"" but where I made Pro a small, one-time fee, the notifications server and its ongoing costs mean that I'd eventually be in the red on that exchange, and keeping Apollo sustainable and healthy for the future is obviously a massive priority of mine. I want to keep the lights on.

On the flipside, I 100% know, understand and agree with [how most feel about subscriptions](https://www.reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8hk2tr/app_subscriptions_suck/). They're abused more and more lately, and they're expensive. So [I talked it over with the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/8k6mkl/lets_talk_about_notifications_sustainability_and/) and I wanted to come up with a reasonable solution to help pay for ongoing server costs, without gouging customers and infuriating them with something crappy.

I knew I couldn't compete with Netflix and whatnot and add another $10/month subscription to users, but as said servers have ongoing costs to me, so I elected to offer an option in the app to pay a meager 99 cents a month and you can have full access to notifications. I really hope you guys can find this reasonable and know I put a ton of work and talk into this update to make it as reasonable as I possibly could. I've worked really hard over the last year to work with the community on Apollo, so please understand that I honestly do really care about the community, and I hope my actions over the last year speak to that even more than my words.

### Show me a video of the features!

Okay! https://vimeo.com/297431875

### So how do I get notifications?

Notifications are bundled into a new pack called ""Apollo Ultra"". Hold up! Why not just call it ""Apollo Notifications""? Well, I did that at first, but it [didn't go so well](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9l3ema/apollo_13_rejected/). Essentially Apple has a rule (3.2.2 subsection ii) that apps can't charge directly for system capabilities like push notifications. Apple very nicely called me and explained that they know there's associated costs with push notifications and the server required for them, but to prevent potential abuse this is a rule they have. They suggested to bundle it in with other features that aren't system capabilities (eg don't bundle it in with AirPlay streaming), and after [talking with the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9l3ema/apollo_13_rejected/) we came up with some simple cool features to add to it that aren't massive deals if you don't have: App Theming (changing the colors of the app around), and some more custom app icons. So the end result is Apollo Ultra is a pack that has notifications, App Theming, and a new custom icon every month.

### What does it notify me of?

It notifies you of everything in your Reddit inbox: post replies, comment replies, username mentions, and private messages.

### Walk me through your process of building this update.

I started with a [thread in the ApolloApp subreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/8k6mkl/lets_talk_about_notifications_sustainability_and/) talking about my plans and to see if it made sense. People seemed to understand the costs and like my concept, so I started building. Then [I got some feedback on the UI](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/91d5pr/notifications_does_this_ui_make_sense_to_yall/) to make sure it was clear and understandable. Fast forward a bit, it had been tested by the community and everyone seemed to like it, so I submitted it to Apple, and [it was unfortunately rejected](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9l3ema/apollo_13_rejected/) (but Apple was cool). People gave some suggestions and ideas. I talked with the community and [laid out my plans](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9muoml/hey_ill_be_less_available_for_the_next_7_days/). I talked to Apple on the phone [and they were super cool and basically agreed with the plans so I updated the community](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9ontns/update_on_apollo_13_and_plans_for_it/) and got to work. I then submitted it, and Apple approved it! And here we are.

### Apollo Pro?

I want to be really, really, really clear that Apollo Pro is not going anywhere, not only that, but it's still the main part of Apollo, and will continue to be indefinitely. Zero plans to change that. So many of you supported Apollo right out of the gates, and the last thing I want to do is give the middle finger to a group of people I owe a ton to. Apollo Ultra is an optional, separate pack that you can get if you want, or ignore if you want. But I have zero plans to move the core of Apollo to a subscription model. The one-time fee model works great, and everyone seems to love it. I don't have any plans to be locking a bunch of extra features into Ultra, and on the flipside I have some really awesome extra features planned for Pro.

### Other notification options?

I mentioned the first option up there uses the device to manage notifications, it uses a combination of Background App Refresh and Local Notifications. Effectively it wakes the app up every so often to make fetches to the server to see if there's any new notifications. This has some downsides, notably that all this is performed on the device, which negatively affects battery life (for instance Apple turns this capability off during Low Power Mode). Further, this fetching can only happen periodically (it varies and is decided by iOS, can be 15 minutes to every several hours in frequency) so the notifications themselves can be quite delayed. I had this as an option called ""Basic Notifications"" in the previous build that was rejected, but don't worry, I plan to add it as an option back, I just wanted to make sure when I submitted this new build everything was clear to Apple and I didn't add any more confusion to potentially get it delayed further. So if you're okay with the above downsides, Apollo will also have a free option for notifications, so please understand that I'm truly trying to be as reasonable about this as possible!

### You could merge Pro and Ultra?

I don't really want to move the Pro features to a subscription model, I like how they are now. It would be more streamlined to just have one ""pack"", yes, but I think in the end this will make everyone happier. For this reason you also don't ""automatically"" get Pro if you get Ultra, because I don't want to conflate the two, and it introduces a lot of complexity around whether or not it should be removed after the subscription expires.

### Still don't like subscriptions, any other options?

You don't have to go by the month, there's a cheaper yearly option for $10, or for a limited time if you really don't like subscriptions there's a lifetime unlock for $20. That price will last for 1 week from today, so act quick if you want it!

### I don't want notifications but still want the other stuff or to support you

You can totally get Apollo Ultra and just leave notifications turned off if they're not your cup of tea, you'll still get everything else and help Apollo's development!

### Tell me about this custom icon every month.

So I figured if I was going to add extra custom icons (which everyone seems to love) to Ultra, I didn't want to just lazily throw in one I threw together in a few minutes. So I worked with The Iconfactory and commissioned them [to build a super sick custom icon](https://www.reddit.com/r/apolloapp/comments/9rd6jp/the_iconfactory_bringing_the_heat_with_a_really/). So basically every month you'll get a cool special icon included as part of Ultra. I worked with some other really talented designers to build some other really cool icons (some with pixel art!) so that these icons look really cool. I want this feature to be awesome.

### iPad update?!

Notifications took a ton of work. But I'm really glad it's behind me because now I can focus on the iPad update. I'm going to be working on 1.4 and 1.5 in tandem with the iPad update so I'm not just going to disappear for awhile, but I'm really stoked to be able to now have a bunch of time to put into the iPad side of things and making the experience for Apollo and Reddit on the iPad spectacular, I have some really cool ideas. :)

### I don't see the 1.3 update in my App Store yet!

It can take up to a few hours sometimes for the update to hit every App Store, so just give it a bit! Sometimes it can also help if you search for the app and go right to its page and hit the ""Update"" button from there rather than the Updates tab.

### Thank You

Just wanted to say a big thank you to everyone who has supported Apollo and allowed this to be my full time job, I'm having a hoot building Apollo and have so much planned for its future, I can't wait to show you, and thanks for making all that possible.

After the altercation my buddy was all bloodied up and managed to pull his phone out just in time as the driver was speeding away. He grabbed a quick picture that ended up being blurry and for days didn't realize it was a Live Photo until he sent it to me. After a couple of replays we were able to clearly get the license plate # and detectives are on the case to bring the POS down. 


Moral of the story: Live Photos aren't as pointless as I thought

apple,562,2019-01-29 15:54:47,cj4962,What's the incentive to switch to an iPhone in 2019?,"TLDR at he bottom. I’ve been using android for 9 years, currently have a Pixel 2 XL, but I’m exploring my options to upgrade later this year.

I’ve been tempted to make the switch since the iPhones got bigger, but the higher price (particularly of the the XS Max) always swings me back to android. I’ve particularly been looking at the XS Max.

Given that I’m not locked into the apple ecosystem (I don’t own any other apple products and have never used an iPhone), I’m finding it hard to justify the ‘Apple Tax’. I know there are cheaper versions of the iPhone available (either via older models or the XR), but if I’m switching from the top end android phones, I don’t want to switch to older phones or have to compromise on what Apple has to offer.

I know that the A12 is a beast, IOS is better optimized, face unlock really has no rivals on Android and iPhones have a very ‘premium’ feel. But stock android is great and despite what people think, stays fast for a number of years. I’m doubtful of the extent to which you notice a faster processor in day to day use, and the finger print scanner on my Pixel is fantastic. I can have my phone unlocked before I even look at the screen. In addition, my Pixel has unlimited cloud storage at full resolution, Samsung (another option I’m looking at) has expandable storage and huge internal storage, and android in general has much cheaper repairs, making me struggle to see the long term value on the other side.

It’s also just a huge slap in the face that I would have to buy a quick charger separately after spending a fortune on an iPhone.

So, putting the above together, why would a long term android user switch to an iPhone in 2019?

TLDR: Been using android for 9 years so I’m not locked into Apples ecosystem. Given the quality, and value for money android devices offer today, why would I spend significantly more to buy into the iPhone in 2019?

Disclaimer: please don't think that I'm hating on Apple, I have nothing against them and genuinely like iPhones. I'm just struggling to justify the purchase in today's phone market, without already being locked into the ecosystem, and genuinely interested in people's thoughts on this.

apple,530,2018-05-28 09:57:30,DiablitoBlanco,Weird iPhone recorded conversation over Bluetooth,"Tldr, new iPhone started playing the audio of a conversation over car Bluetooth that was had on it the day before from no discoverable source within the phone, only stopped with initiation of a call. Where was it playing from and how/why was it recorded?

Story: finally convinced GF to get her first iPhone (8 Plus) a couple days ago. Yay blue text. Last night I'm driving her car, we're listening to music on my iPhone X via USB connection, hers is connected via Bluetooth to the dash. 

She had just finished watching a video of her nephew on her phone when all of a sudden my USB music gets muted and the car Bluetooth acts as if it's in an active phone call playing audio over the speakers of a phone conversation she had the day before with her girlfriend. I'm hearing both ends of their conversation. Somehow their conversation was recorded and is now being played back.

I take her phone and look in her phone app, there's no active call, no voicemail being played back, the control center doesn't show an active pause-able media being played. On her Bluetooth display it's showing as if it's an active ongoing call. We try clicking ""end call"" on the car screen but nothing. I finally terminated it by going into her phone and initiating a call to me. 

So where was this coming from? And why the hell was her entire phone call somehow recorded? We're both really confused and she's freaked out about ""iPhones and privacy"" now. 

Edit to add details, it was on T-Mobile in a Toyota Scion. As someone else suggested, I almost wonder if it was the car and not the iPhone since the phone had no indication it was putting out any audio or engaged in a call, but I'm still baffled. She's had the car about 6 months and nothing like this ever happened on her POS Android. 

Edit 2: she went through her voicemails and found that the call was recorded/saved in her voicemail. Sounds like carrier T-Mobile thing? And she is the one who made the call, so not like she answered a call as it was getting sent to VM. And doesn't explain how when I went into her phone app it wasn't showing it was playing a voicemail and she denies having been in her voicemail prior to the event but.. 🤷🏼‍♂️",https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/8moy7t/weird_iphone_recorded_conversation_over_bluetooth/

apple,506,2018-06-24 15:09:29,tetea_t,PSA: Prevent (hopefully) iPhone thieves from making changes to your Apple account (should you happen to be robbed and forced to disclose your passcode),"First of all, I included the word “hopefully” because this is not a foolproof measure (as I will discuss later in the post) so I really hope Apple will do something about it.

So, a few weeks ago I came across a post here where an iPhone was robbed and the owner was forced to disclose his passcode. He later learned that his Apple account was compromised because the robber was able to change his trusted device and thereby change his account password. Then just today the same problem was faced by u/advil0 as posted [here](https://reddit.com/r/apple/comments/8tbvtb/how_two_factor_authentication_screwed_me/). This is a serious security issue and it left me wondering what could be done to protect my account from being ‘hacked’.

The only additional security setting that is currently available to thwart such an incident is to set Restrictions in the Settings:

Settings > General > Restrictions > Accounts

You set a restrictions PIN (something different from your normal phone passcode) and ‘dont allow changes’ for ‘Accounts’. This will effectively prevent anyone who might know your phone passcode from making changes to your Apple Account from that particular phone. To make changes later you will need to disable Restrictions first using the PIN that you had earlier set.

Now it should be noted that thieves might be aware of this trick and may force you to also divulge your Restrictions PIN. But until Apple introduces some counter-measure in their upcoming updates, then we can only hope iPhone thieves are left in the blind regarding this issue.

Hopefully, this may help someone from losing their account should they ever be in a similar situation. 

Also, I tried to post this on r/apple but the moderator bot somehow deletes it for violating *“Rule 11: No posts or comments relating to buying, selling, trading, giveaways or asking for advice about any of those topics.”* Go figure.

**TLDR: Set a Restrictions PIN in Settings > General > Restrictions > Accounts to prevent thieves from changing you Apple account details should you ever be forced to disclose your iPhone passcode.**

**Edit 1:** As highlighted by /u/BruteSentiment I have failed to inform you that you should be careful to not *ever* lose the Restrictions PIN. Take note:

>	IF YOU FORGET YOUR RESTRICTIONS PASSCODE, YOU WILL LOSE ALL DATA ON YOUR DEVICE IF YOU EVER MOVE TO A NEW DEVICE OR NEED TO RESTORE OR REPAIR.

>THIS INCLUDES BACKUPS, BOTH ON ICLOUD AND ON ITUNES.

>THERE ARE NO PASSCODE RECOVERY OPTIONS AVAILABLE, EITHER THROUGH THE WEBSITE, THE STORES, OR CALLING TIM COOK HIMSELF.

Realized it maybe, 20 minutes after it began. I couldn't find my phone, then it clicked that that's where it might be. The floor is soaked, but I found my phone lol.

So far, calls work, facetime works, cameras work, performance seems to work, i'm just worried something will come up. Thank god for Apple Care.

Any tests I should run to check if all is well, or just wait it out? Has anyone else done anything this stupid and want to make me feel better?

apple,432,2018-05-25 13:50:14,az9393,I’ve been using an iPhone X without a case for over 6 months. Here is what it looks like.,"So briefly about my usage: 

I used the X as a main device, so everyday for everything like calls internet, chats etc. I sometimes carry another phone with me as a backup or for whatever reason but since I got the X it has been pretty much the only phone I used. 

I drive a lot (at least 2-3 trips a day) and work in an office, I also go to the gym almost every day. (I have a bumper case for the gym but I’ve only used it for the first few months and don’t anymore) I use my phone in all those situations for music/navigation etc. 

I rarely have any battery left at the end of the day so I’m a heavy user you might say. 

I try to be careful with my phones: I’ll never put it in a pocket with something else for example etc. but I do occasionally drop them (my 4 had a cracked screen and so did the 5s). I dropped the X a few times and remarkably only one of them had left a mark (two) on the side. I’d say I’m a 3,5/5 for being careful with my phone overall. (1 being playing football with it, 5 being handling it with velvet gloves on). 

So here are the results of my usage without the case: 

[The iPhone X under direct sunlight (more more scratchy details)](https://imgur.com/a/uCI7Apk/)

[The iPhone X indoor pictures (how it normally looks like)](https://imgur.com/a/tUB2TRv/)

[The iPhone 7s Plus, previous phone for comparison, 6 months usage and actually a lot of that in a pouch case ](https://imgur.com/a/U4KlQul/)

As you can see the results are pretty remarkable. The X is very durable to scratches compared to the other smartphones I’ve used before (and I’ve used a lot of them) and it’s actually quite shatter resistant from my experience also. Did you know that the glass on the iPhone X is 1.5 times thicker than on previous models? The stainless steel frame also holds against scratches or scuffs very well(huge problem on previous aluminum iPhones) although this is only true for the space grey version, I’m not sure why. 

I’ve never liked using a case for the phone. I get all the advantages but I feel like you aren’t using the true advantages of design and feel. To me it feels like buying a really pretty car and wrapping it in ugly plastic so that it doesn’t get scuffed or scratched. I like my phone to feel premium, slim and light. So I’ve never used a case, and mostly it was always fine. (7s is an exception because that jet black is ridiculous, it even got badly scratched with the case smh)

The point of this isn’t to convince people to not wear cases, but if you were wondering what it could be like, you have your answer. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/8m1w50/ive_been_using_an_iphone_x_without_a_case_for/

apple,352,2018-10-29 21:17:06,apple_bruce,"Upgraded to XS Max, really miss convenience of Touch ID","Hi all.

I recently upgraded to a XS Max from an iPhone 7 and want to share my experience adjusting to the new iPhone. I was a unsure the size would work for me but after a week of use, now I don't notice the size; in fact, the iPhone 7 feels too small. The screen real estate is so good.

The only thing that's really bothering me is the lack of Touch ID. I don't have an issue with Face ID, it works fine, but I miss Touch ID because it worked without having to actually look at the phone.

Three specific examples:

1) I have soft token apps for work (RSA, Mi-Token, etc). When I need to use them, I used to be able to just reach over to my iPhone, rest a finger on the Home button, tap the token app and glance at the iPhone to get the code. I didn't need to look away from my computer until the app was open on the iPhone, so no loss of focus on my work, it was all very seamless and really easy.  But now with Face ID I have to either pick up the iPhone and point it towards me, or move my head over to it. This really pulls me out of my zone, it's distracting, and requires more effort.

2) Using Face ID for Apply Pay is annoying. With Touch ID it was so much easier: get to the checkout, as I'm pulling my iPhone out of my pocket, rest a finger on the Home button to double-click it, it reads the finger print, I tap the phone on the reader and all done. I didn't have to break eye contact with the checkout chick, could keep putting my moves on her. But now with Face ID there's an awkward moment where I pull my iPhone out, hold the phone with two hands to double-press the Power button, then hold it towards my face to get Face ID to work before tapping the phone on the reader.

3) Using your mobile phone while driving is illegal in Australia. Like a lot of people, I use my iPhone to play music in the car via Bluetooth, and to change plylists I have to actually use iTunes. With Touch ID, it was really easy to do the sneaky and have my phone in my lap, unlock it with Touch ID, tap the iTunes app, and start scrolling for the playlist - all out of my peripheral vision. Not so much with Face ID, now I have to raise the phone up to get a good view of my face which definitely requires more attention.

This is absolutely a First World Problem and I'm sure I'll adapt in the long-term. I'm at a point in my life where devices should integrate seamlessly into my life, they shouldn't add any kind of burden, and for optimal usability, I shouldn't have to change too much to use them. Face ID doesn't do this for me - it constantly requires me to divert my attention to the iPhone. A 4-digit passcode would be more seamless but that's just heresy. I can only hope Apple find some way to bring Touch ID back without a Home button.

Cheers.

When you try to send them something using AirDrop, it checks their contact list for your Apple ID email address, and if it's not there, you won't see their phone as a drop target (unless they set their AirDrop receive to ""Everyone"").

This sucks if they only have your phone number, or a different email address. But you can remedy that by adding your phone number and alternate emails to your ""Reachable"" list. 

Simply go to [AppleID](https://appleid.apple.com), choose Account and add your phone number and email addresses under the ""Reachable At"" section. And you'll suddenly find that you can use AirDrop to share things with friends nearby a lot more often.

apple,313,2018-09-23 14:55:03,advillious,iPhone XS applies very aggressive smoothing effect to front camera photos. (Examples included),"I just compared this with my iPhone X and it's extremely evident. The Smart HDR on the XS is a great effect but the smoothing on the skin and other effects decreases sharpness by a very significant amount. 

I feel weird posting selfies on here but here's an example. 

iPhone X: https://i.imgur.com/yXwzIRJ.jpg

Note the blown out highlights in the window, this is what I was actually testing. 

iPhone XS Max: https://i.imgur.com/5t7rpnf.jpg

Note that the smoothing isn't only on my face, but my shirt too. You can't even see the pilling on my old t-shirt anymore. The decrease in sharpness is also evident in my hair but most obvious on my skin, which is likely the intention. 

I think this effect is hard-coded in because I notice it on instagram/snapchat's default cameras too. This should be addressed. I already reported it to https://www.apple.com/feedback and even emailed it to some of the execs at Apple. Craig Federighi has responded to an email from me in the past so hopefully he repeats!

apple,304,2018-10-21 11:38:54,vantt1,LPT: how to easily tell if your iPhone screen is an aftermarket copy without taking it apart,"This tip might be useful for those who recently got their screen replaced by a third-party repairer (if they said the screen is original but you have your doubts), bought a ""new"" iPhone from eBay or is thinking of buying a second-hand iPhone off of someone.

The usual telltale signs are worse touch sensitivity, poor brightness/color reproduction, high reflectivity and a bad fit (i.e. edges of the screen don't smoothly meet the unibody). But unless you have a known original iPhone screen to compare side-by-side, it can be hard to tell by eye. Inspecting the screen on the inside is often more conclusive but you might not or cannot do that in some cases.

Shine ~~your phone's~~ a torch/flashlight (your phone's will work well if it's another iPhone you're inspecting) onto the screen and look at the light's reflection in the screen. An aftermarket copy screen will have gridlines running through it, while an original screen will not. 

[Aftermarket](https://gfycat.com/NecessaryGorgeousKiwi)

[Original](https://gfycat.com/MintySatisfiedGonolek)

This method works on all iPhones that have an [in-cell touch digitizer](https://www.anandtech.com/show/6330/the-iphone-5-review/15) (iPhone 5 and onwards, through to the iPhone 8/Plus). 

Whether the screen is aftermarket or not is **especially** important on models that have 3D Touch, as the Touch IC has migrated from the logic board to the screen flex cable. An aftermarket screen will have an [aftermarket IC](https://imgur.com/vl1weu3) (the silver rectangular block on the black flex cable), which has a fair chance of being bricked by a major iOS update.",https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/9q2vnc/lpt_how_to_easily_tell_if_your_iphone_screen_is/

Introducing the feature-packed, ad-free, open-source, and beautifully designed Reddit app that has been loved on Android since 2015 and has been written from the ground up for the App Store","Hello r/iphone users!

My name is Carlos, and I am a university student that has been developing one of the most popular third party Reddit apps on Android, Slide for Reddit, for a little over three years now. In this time, Slide has gained a reputation for being ad-free and open-source, feature-packed, and beautifully designed, and I have spent the last year or so delving into the Apple ecosystem to bring the same features and a fresh, new design to iOS! Slide brings something totally unique to Redditing on iOS devices, and I am extremely excited to announce that Slide iOS is now accepting applications for public Beta Testing on TestFlight! If you are interested in becoming a tester or contributing code to Slide, there is more information about this test at the bottom of the post.

Slide on iOS has been designed from the ground up to be fast and feature packed, with a fresh and *unique* Material Design inspired UI that is simple to use and extremely customizable (thousands of theme and layout combinations). Slide is fully offline-capable, which means you can cache your favorite subreddits and comments for when you are offline, and Slide supports your favorite content sites such as Streamable.com, v.redd.it videos, Imgur albums (for free), and Gfycat.com links, just to name a few.

Slide is also **fully open-source** under an Apache 2 license, with a repository on Github that is actively accepting contributions!

# What makes Slide unique?

For starters, Slide iOS is based off of the design and feature set of Slide on Android ( [r/slideforreddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/slideforreddit) ), which has been built over years and has had extensive testing, evolution, and user feedback. This means that you can expect a sizable feature set that feels intuitive to use and learn, and a tried and tested design that has been modified to feel right at home on iOS.

[**Here are some promotional images for Slide**](https://imgur.com/a/f9kGbHl) that will be featured on the App Store when Slide exits Beta!

Some other features include:

* Make each subreddit unique with its own theme colors and accents, and automatically pull these colors from supported subreddits
* Reply to comments and submissions **inline** without opening a reply window, and upload images anonymously to Imgur straight into to your submissions/comments
* Most feature-rich and easy to use moderation suite on iOS, with support for mod mail, and per-subreddit mod queues
* Many view types including compact mode for dense information display and beautiful card layout for enjoying photos
* Gallery and shadowbox modes give you a new way to view your favorite subreddits
* Extensive data-saving options, with quality modes and WiFi toggle
* Sync your Slide settings between all your iCloud devices
* Theme choices include a beautiful true black AMOLED theme, sepia theme, blue theme, and white theme
* Powerful filter system to block out what you don’t want to see, including content types (ex. filter gifs from [r/all](https://www.reddit.com/r/all)) and domains
* View and delete your browsing history, or turn off history completely to go incognito
* “Casual” subscriptions that won’t show up on your frontpage
* Multi-account support
* Ad-Block in websites using the built-in web view
* Optimized for iPad viewing with configurable columns and popup comment views
* Automatic caching for your morning commute
* Automatic night theme with custom activation hours
* Powerful drafts system
* Multireddit support
* 7 fonts to choose from, and submission titles/comments can have different fonts
* Link url/content type previews to make sure you don't click on anything too risky
* Default post sorting per-subreddit
* User tagging (like RES)
* Lightweight and blazing fast

apple,265,2018-06-16 02:54:38,DatGameBoi,This iPhone 150mb limit is fucking stupid,"We seriously need to look at this feature and get the attention of Apple on this. I don’t think I’ve seen a more useless feature ever. It’s a senseless limitation for the sake of it. Maybe this was useful for like 2000-2004 when 3G was all we could get and all data plans had like a 1G limit. This is 2018 where mobile carriers are nearly putting out more MBS then our land line cable companies. Seriously, I got 4 different explanations about how it’s there to keep me from going over my limit... Well that’s obsolete because unlimited data plans. The other explanation I got was because it was faster... that’s not right because I get 100mbs on cellular and only 25mbs on my own in home WiFi. Third was, It’s so that it doesn’t interrupt the downloads.. wrong again you can manually do that ALL you want by simply pausing the download or activating airplane mode. The fourth one was because someone said the network towers couldn’t handle it and wrong again because android phones do this with ZERO problems. This seems like a ploy by Apple to push internet sales. Further more is just flat out stupid and has arguably ZERO use. Somebody needs to say something to Apple. I have, I know you guys aren’t a personal army, not begging anyone to be one. Just saying this is extremely stupid. 

Edit: here is the Apple feed back Incase you guys want to submit without having to dig for it.

[Apple feedback](https://www.apple.com/feedback/iphone.html) 

Edit: Just to be clear on my stance on this, this NEEDS to be a feature we can pick and chose with. Majority of the users this effects which should be the vast majority of those of us who live in places where we can get unlimited data. This isn’t up for Apple to decide for us. This should be for us to decide if we want this on or not. There needs to be an off switch for this. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/iphone/comments/8rgk34/this_iphone_150mb_limit_is_fucking_stupid/

Idk) you can see a difference, but if you hold your phone like a regular person (like everyone else) it’s not even an issue, it’s sharp for the regular person. The panel is great and viewing angels are good. The benefit of this display? The battery life on the XR is phenomenal. I haven’t found an issue yet with this phone. If anyone on this sub is specifically thinking about switching from a recent Galaxy to the XR, I’d say do it. It’s a great all around device. I’m going to post my full 24hr review tomorrow!

apple,262,2018-11-06 16:14:59,jcepiano,I tested the Pixel 3 and iPhone XS for a week - here's a detailed analysis and my choice between the two,"I posted some thoughts about the Apple iPhone XS in comparison to the Google Pixel 3 [(post here)](https://www.reddit.com/r/Android/comments/9tnmm6/my_take_on_the_pixel_3_vs_iphone_xs/) and wanted to write a detailed final analysis of the two phones for everyone’s benefit. While this is what I came away with after a week of serious testing on both devices, I think any person could come up with a different decision depending on what they want to prioritize for their money. I’m happy to answer any questions for those still on the fence or curious about particular aspects of these phone’s performance.

I’ve been an owner of both Apple and Android based products over the past 10 years and don’t really have a “fanboy” bias towards one camp or the other.

For anyone undecided about these two phones, I’d highly suggest not only following MKBHD’s five pillars of a smartphone (build, performance, battery, display, camera) but also following his suggestion during a recent interview on SuperSaf TV about needing to prioritize those five for your needs and then making a decision based on that. For my needs, I rank the pillars in this order: performance, display, camera, battery, build. 

**PERFORMANCE**

iOS and Android are best represented by these two phones. iOS with gestures is a very immersive experience. Although the lifeless grid of app icons still hasn’t changed, the experience on iOS is more practical and polished. Animations are fluid and the A12 bionic chip doesn’t break a sweat even with intense app switching and graphic processing. 

For me, Android is all about personalized minimalism. Although Samsung and One Plus allow more unusual customizations, I find that stock Android is true simplicity. The gestures  in Android Pie are a welcome change but I have to say they feel unfinished. The way in which one has to double swipe up from the bottom to get the app drawer to open (or one long swipe if you have a big thumb) needs improvement like many other details in the operating system. They say an update is coming but if you care about raw power, the RAM management issues clearly lead to apps needing to refresh before opening. Even a week in, I’ve seen some random stalls already in some typical apps. 

Apple’s iOS is noticeably more complete - albeit a bit boring. Android Pie has great possibilities but it just isn’t a finished product at this moment and I don’t have an interest in being a test subject while Google puts their finishing touches on the user experience.

**DISPLAY**

Both phones have great quality displays. The entire iPhone is maybe 1-2mm shorter than the Pixel 3 but it has a much larger and substantial display. The Pixel screen has vivid colors and doesn’t leave much to be desired - however, in low light, there is a black crush issue. I noticed blacks lagging to respond as they are turned off, which leads to the impression of black spots smudging as you scroll. This doesn’t happen on the iPhone panel at similar brightness levels. Also, I noticed a number of times that the extreme corners of the Pixel’s screen are not always accurate and responsive to finger inputs in comparison to the iPhone’s at similar points in the display.

Both are solid but the iPhone exploits the total dimensions of the phone’s footprint for a huge screen (yes, even with a notch that I never even think about) that makes viewing media and text easier on the eyes.

**CAMERA**

I tested the hell out of these two cameras to the point my friends thought I was crazy. I didn’t trust the YouTube videos and needed to see results for myself in the world I see from day to day.

Apple has made some serious progress over the last couple of years in the photography department and I think there’s a reason why every YouTube tech reviewer is comparing these two flagship cameras. First thing is first - for still photography, the Pixel is far more successful than the iPhone. However, with some extra shooting and some post-shooting editing, the iPhone is extremely competitive and sometimes even beats out the Pixel. 

There is one really important thing that you have to consider if you’re choosing between both phones - if you’re primarily using your phone to share photos to social media, where sizes tend to be smaller and where photos are primarily viewed on mobile phone displays, then the difference is relatively negligible between the two cameras, especially if you do any detailed editing. I spent some time editing XS photos to mimic Pixel and frankly, it just isn’t that hard to get close to a similar image composition. On the other hand, if you open up an image on a computer and zoom in to check details, you’ll definitely see the minor and sometimes major flaws in iPhone’s photos.

I have found that Pixel typically sacrifices color and light accuracy in exchange for sharpness and dramatic composition. It’s pretty clear that Google uses computational processing to create images that use striking contrast to produce an almost 3D effect in how it layers shadows and colors. A side effect is that sometimes sunsets will be strangely subdued (while they should be vivid with color) or skin will seem abnormally textured (something a real camera typically doesn’t do). In contrast, iPhone aims for more realistic color but flattens out and heavily evens out images. Shadows on the iPhone tend to be reduced and in low light, there is usually a ton of noise and loss of data, especially on the selfie shooter. 

If video and audio recording is of serious importance to your decision, stop reading this and get the iPhone. The iPhone XS has a great microphone and rich 4K video with many shooting configurations. Pixel has better stabilization but it comes at a price - Google crops the image down so that it can work with the outer edge of the images in order to beautifully dial in stabilization but it loses visual definition in the process. Also without the computational photography, the video on the pixel seems like it comes from a sub $500 budget handset instead of a $800+ flagship. 

Pixel takes it for photos (if you want something ready to go on social media without editing) but iPhone is almost neck and neck with a little help from editing. For Video and audio, iPhone is leading the industry.

**BATTERY**

There is no comparison between these two batteries. iPhone’s standby time is absurd (losing 2% in 8 hours in my testing). I can fully charge the battery, use the phone staring first thing in the morning with a heavy dose of YouTube videos, Redditing, emails, phone calls, facetime calls, and still have 15-20% right before I go to sleep. With the Pixel, as you approach the late afternoon into evening, you’ll be dipping into the mid 30s with several hours to go before the end of the day. I think most heavy users will need to top off the Pixel to last through an entire day.

iPhone outshines the Pixel with battery endurance but I should point out that the Pixel has far better fast charging than the iPhone. Also, screw Apple for not including a proper fast charger in the box! (Pro tip: get at 12W charger instead of the official fast charger for the XS. It’s virtually the same and costs less)

**BUILD**

Both phones are really well built. iPhone is over the top with its thick glass, stainless steel, and overall weight. I find the XS to be slightly too heavy for extended one handed use and also continually fear about dropping it. The pixel is so beautifully designed for the hand. It’s light, feels durable, and in general it is reminiscent of the Galaxy S8 but without the screen melting off the sides. Both have stereo speakers with solid volume. Pixel has some obvious bass vibration in the body of the phone. iPhone has beautifully tuned dual speakers and they generally sound better equalized and detailed in comparison to the pixel. 

While I’d like to call it a tie, i think the implementation of the larger display and speaker quality gives it to the iPhone. 

One side note: I noticed audio is generally better on the iPhone in comparison to the Pixel. /u/AmirZ pointed out this important piece of information in my last post and I wanted to pass it along here:
>Android unfortunately upsamples from 44.1kHz to 48kHz by default, which can reduce the audio quality if your source doesn't support Direct PCM passthrough or Compressed Offload (if the music player doesn't decode to WAV). iPhone on the other hand is much smarter and uses the proper output sampling rate from what I've heard. So that might contribute to the worse quality. Also, the new Pixel dongle has a terrible AMP with only 0.4V output, compared to the 0.7V+ that is standard across other phones.

**CONCLUSION**

As you can see, the iPhone took 3 of the 5 categories or pillars without much of a fight. As I seriously contemplated this decision, I was desperately holding on to two things from Android - an industry leading still photography camera and a stock operating system - against everything that Apple offers at $300 more. This is where you need to decide what you’re willing to sacrifice. Ultimately, the loss of video recording with quality audio is a deal breaker for what I want from a phone. 

If point and shoot photography and Google services and/or customization is your priority, Pixel is a no brainer. It’s cheaper than Apple, takes ready to publish photos 8 out of 10 times (I’d call iPhone’s photos strong 5 out of 10 times) and the smaller Pixel 3 feels absolutely amazing in the hand. It’s snappy and will be at the front of the line in the Android world for updates for at least the next two years.

But If you want a high power flagship that every competitor will try to knock down, the iPhone XS, like Samsung’s Note 9, gives you everything that you would realistically need. I’ll be first to admit that it’s less exciting to use than Android, but the elegance and reliability of the experience in combination with industry leading video & audio, makes it the phone for me for the next few years.

**TL:DR:** The iPhone XS overtakes the Pixel 3 in a number of areas this year. Apple is more competitive in computational photography (look at the insane amount of camera comparisons on YouTube) than I would have expected. Google dropped the ball on a few things that matter to me when they're charging a premium price, so I’ll spend a little more cash and get something that every competitor will be measuring itself against.

I have had my stopwatch running for years. It started on my iPod, after which I bought an iPhone 6S. I was surprised to see the stopwatch continue where it left off when I opened the clock app for the first time on my iPhone.

The thought crossed my mind that it might mess something up with my stopwatch, but I figured the two functions weren't related with each other. So I would be fine. Well, turns out I was wrong. I reopened the clock app like an hour after setting the alarm and I was meeted with the stopwatch screen at 0 hours, 0 minutes and 0 seconds. The end of an era.

apple,207,2018-09-13 17:37:43,Halko_Proude,Tip for iPhone 6/6s/7/8 users thinking of upgrading to the XR,"So, most of the negative comments on the XR I have been seeing since the reveal (besides the price) have been about the pixel resolution, which is 1792-by-828 at 326ppi.

I just want to point out that the iPhone 6/6s/7/8 screens have all been using the same resolution of 1334-by-750 at 326ppi, so you're technically going to get about the same (possibly slightly better) resolution for the XR if you've been using anything besides the Plus/X models.

Given this, you can think of the XR as the iPhone 7/8 of 2018/19 in terms of resolution, but with great specs everywhere else (processor, GPU, camera, etc.), and could reasonably justify upgrading to the XR in October :)

But here's the problem: my money is little, and I have to buy other things (laptop, tv, etc..) together with a new phone. I could get a brand new 128 GB - I can't fit into 32 - 7 for 550 euros (around 650 dollars. I don't like Plus versions, and 8 and X are seriously too expensive for my budget), but that wouldn't leave a lot of bucks for the remaining things.

So, searching on the net, I saw that I could get a 64 GB 6S for 290 euros (around 340 dollars). It is refurbished, but it is also guaranteed to be as good as a brand new one.

google,5384,2018-10-23 08:44:06,g43m,This community needs a reality check,"The RAM management issues on the Pixel 3 are quite serious, and many people are having issues. Someone here had their navigation randomly switched off, and many bloggers / tech journalists have pointed out that apps randomly shut down due to this issue. It may be battery optimization or RAM optimization or whatever. The point is, I do not care what the excuse is and neither should anybody else. The problem is, that part of this community is so far up Google's arse that some urgent issues get down voted into an oblivion.

If you are paying so much money for a device, the damn thing should JUST WORK! I am a huge Google fan boy, but their incoherent and ridiculous strategy of pricing like iPhone but giving totally mediocre after care is really starting to piss me off, and it should piss all of you off as well. As fanboys, it is okay to say that Pixels take the best photos. It is okay to say you get pure android. But it is NOT okay to accept mediocre. It is NOT okay to pay upward of USD 1000 for a device and be Google's beta tester.

I remember Steve Jobs coming on stage during one of the iPhone events more than 7 years ago, and getting huge applause when he said - 'It just works'. Unfortunately we cannot say that about any of Googles mobile offerings. Messaging is an incoherent mess more than a few years after iMessage, the Nexus 5x turned out to be a sham, and Pixel is slowly headed there with the completely brain dead decision to put a hideous notch, and now this lack of software optimization. Heck, my current $200 Huawei Honor 6x (which many of you may not even have heard of) with 4 GB RAM and a Snapdragon 625 SoC handles multitasking like a champ, so there is absolutely no excuse for a device that costs 5 times more (and possibly has 5 times better benchmarks) to get basic things wrong.

TL;DR - stop mindlessly defending Google

Edit: this post has garnered way more attention than I expected. The fact that it has been reported several times literally proves the point I am trying to make. In any case, there have been a few productive discussions, and I think everyone can agree on the following:

- Let's report problems to Google via the feedback option on phones. There a separate thread. Not sure if linking is allowed.
- some people have had no problems, and that is great. Hopefully there will be fewer problems going ahead.
- let's be nicer to people facing issues rather than down voting because we do not agree that the issue is significant enough. 
- work arounds are nice. Fixes and patches by Google are better. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9qn20z/this_community_needs_a_reality_check/

It would not turn on past the startup screen so I contacted google and they offered to replace it. I sent it to google returns in Grapevine, TX using the return label they sent me, and according to the tracking number it was delivered on August 24th. I was told it would take 7-14 days to replace it. But after 3 weeks I had not received my phone or heard anything from google. I tried contacting them and was told that they never received it even though the tracking number says it was received and signed for.  They said I would receive any updates as they come, but to no surprise there has not been a single update.  I have tried getting this problem solved through support chat, calling, and the pixel forum but nothing has helped make any progress in getting my phone. It seems like they must have lost it to me, but it’s been upwards of 3 months and I’d really just like to have my old phone back. Is there anything I can do to fix this?

google,3395,2018-10-20 14:31:23,Yoojinlee,FYI: Buying a Pixel has an Arbitration Agreement,"I'm not sure if people are aware of this since I didn't really see anyone else mention this but it seems that as a condition of buying a Pixel 3 or Pixel 3 XL you agree to a binding arbitration agreement (you agree to waive your right to a class action lawsuit and instead say that you'll use arbitration to settle disputes) if you purchase and do not return your Pixel within 30 days of activation if you do not opt out of said agreement. This kind of rubbed me the wrong way even though I know it's now just becoming standard to include these agreements in the terms of service for many things.

You can opt out of the agreement pretty easily, however, by using g.co/pixel/optout. Make sure that you do it in the 30 days though. Just letting people know in case they weren't aware. I'm loving my Pixel 3 XL otherwise.

Edit: Here are the pictures of said agreement: http://imgur.com/a/SA4ovsi

Edit 2: Someone else mentioned that the agreement is also in the set up process.

Edit 3: If you're not in the US this agreement probably doesn't apply to you.

google,2277,2018-10-30 02:41:14,cerebiggum,"FedEx lost shipment, google won't send me a replacement","FedEx says they delivered my phone but the camera at my house show that they never showed up. While on the phone with FedEx they said it was delivered to a house three blocks away. They were unable to recover the phone after 48 hours and now consider the package ""lost"". It's been a week since FedEx admits they lost the package. The law requires that Google give me either a refund or a new shipping date but they have done neither although I call them every day ([https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0221-billed-merchandise-you-never-received](https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/articles/0221-billed-merchandise-you-never-received)).

Last time FedEx delivered something to the wrong address (with a $1,000 Sony television) I just stopped payment on my credit card because after two weeks I got fed up with being the intermediary between Sony and FedEx. However, I have learned (and Google confirmed) that if I stop VISA payment I will get blacklisted by Google an all my services will get stopped. I use and pay for many Google services so this would not be good - now I'm reconsidering being so vendor-locked and might start divesting myself from Google after 14 years.

What are my options?

Google, if you see this, WTF!?

&#x200B;

Edit: I didn't expect this post to get so much attention, I was really just venting! Some people asked why I didn't use chat so a paper trail would exist so I tried it out for today's attempt: [chat session](https://imgur.com/nvXmZhP). I think the chat is pretty representative of the phone calls I've had. In the chat he asks for me to reply to the email I got from the support team. However, that email thread is nearly all me trying to get updates without a response.

&#x200B;

Update: Google has [responded](https://imgur.com/ScwoF4x) claiming that the order \*was\* delivered (see below). FedEx is now sending me a ""letter of explanation"" proving that they lost the package and that I did not receive it. I have no idea what Google has been doing for the last 7 days or why they couldn't call FedEx and simply ask them if the package was lost or not. Seriously, WTF google!?

`Thanks for contacting us about your order. We’ve carefully reviewed your case and our records confirm that your order was successfully delivered to the address you provided.`

`If the address you provided as the shipping address belongs to a company or a non-residential location, please contact them to track down your package.`

`Unfortunately, we’re unable to replace your order as Google has fulfilled our services by successfully delivering your complete order to the location you provided.` 

`As a next step, you may consider initiating an investigation with the carrier or notify local law enforcement. We’ll be happy to assist in an investigation.`

&#x200B;

Update 2: I spoke with an extremely unhelpful FedEx ""customer advocate"" who was unwilling to state ""yes or no"" if FedEx had lost the package when I asked for a simple written statement and indicated that I should open a claim. After 20 minutes of arguing I ended the call and confirmed that a claim had already been opened last week when I reported the package missing. I called back and a very helpful FedEx employee took over my case and said the computer did indicate that they had lost the package and that she would send all the paperwork they had to me - but it would take 5 to 7 days. I've also sent a reply to Google stating that FedEx admits they lost the package. Am I taking crazy pills? She also mentioned that because the pre-tax value ($999) was under $1000 they didn't need a signature. Also, she said that since Google did not report a value they would only be entitled to $100 from FedEx for the lost shipment.

&#x200B;

Update 3: A community manager from Google has messaged me and now I guess they are looking in to the matter internally. I also gave /u/dmziggy my information, I'm not sure how much someone who doesn't work at google can help but it's worth a shot. At this point FedEx has admitted fault but says that only the shipper can initiate a claim. On the other hand Google is claiming that since the package was delivered it is up to me and local law enforcement to deal with the problem. From my side the disconnect appears to be between Google and FedEx and I don't really understand where my role is in this ridiculous debate.

&#x200B;

Update 4 - REPLACEMENT BEING SHIPPED: A new person has replied to the support email and Google has reversed their decision and will replace the phone with 2nd day air shipping. I'm not sure if the community manager had anything to do with it but I'm assuming this Reddit attention helped push it through - so thanks to everyone who made my post popular. I hope Google learns from my experience so it doesn't happen to anyone else. I still don't know what went on behind the scenes between Google and FedEx but they need to get on the same page when it comes to deliveries.

google,1910,2018-05-22 17:49:06,trickinit,My Google Trade-in Nightmare,"Chalk me up as another sucker for Google's trade-in program. I should have known better. I’ve read all the horror stories people have had. I guess I just hoped it had been up and running long enough that the issues would be worked out by now. Plus it just seemed much easier than trying to sell it on my own. Huge mistake.

Here are the detailed logs of my interactions with Google over the last six(!) weeks of trying to get this resolved.

* **3/18/18** – I purchased a Pixel 2 XL 64GB and initiated a trade-in for my old Pixel XL 32GB. The offer stated that I would receive a refund of **$288.00** to my Synchrony account as long as it powered on, had no cracks in the screen, and had been factory reset. The phone was in mint condition. I had never used it without a case or screen protector and it was literally flawless. Looking back, I should have sold the phone on Swappa. I’m sure I would have gotten a bit more money out of it. I just got caught up in the (supposed) ease of trading it in.
* **3/26/18** – I received the trade-in kit and recorded video of me performing a factory reset, powering off the phone, and sealing it in the box. I made sure to show the phone from all angles to make it clear that there was nothing wrong with it. Then I dropped it off at the post office.
* **3/30/18** – The phone arrived at its destination in Atlanta.
* **4/6/18** – I received a partial refund of **$165.60** with a note claiming “phone doesn’t turn on/off”. I called in to dispute it, spoke with a rep named Zander who assured me it would be resolved shortly. He asked me to submit my video of the phone working and was told I would be updated within 24-48 hours. I emailed him the video while still on the phone with him and he told me he received it. I was assigned case number: **4-5739000021983**.
* **4/10/18** – I emailed Zander back asking for a status update and received no reply.
* **4/13/18** – I emailed Zander again, still no reply.
* **4/17/18** – I contacted Google via web chat and was told the case was still being investigated and that I should hear back from them soon.
* **4/27/18** – I contacted them via web chat again with the same response- it was still being investigated.
* **5/3/18** – I called in to check on the status and spoke with a rep named Christy. She said she would personally help me get this resolved and that she would re-escalate the case to an account specialist since no progress had taken place. She said she would stay in contact and that I would hear back in 3-5 days. I was assigned a new case number: **6-9336000022109**.
* **5/7/18** – Christy emailed me to say that they were still looking into it and that she would keep me updated.
* **5/12/18** – Christy emailed me again to say the same thing, it was still being worked on with no progress.
* **5/18/18** – Christy called me and said the investigation had been concluded. She wouldn’t give me any details about it but said the best they could do is give me a **$50** Google Store credit. I told her I didn’t think that was acceptable as I was supposed to receive an additional refund of **$122.40**, not a credit towards a future purchase. At this point I'll never buy something from them again so the credit is worthless. She put me on hold and came back offering me additional **$30** credit. I didn’t accept that as it still wasn’t what I had been promised and I don’t want to settle. I purchased the phone on the premise that I would receive the full **$288.00** as a refund. She then hung up on me!
* I called back in and was transferred to the Order Management team. I was placed on hold multiple times for 45 minutes without accomplishing anything. This rep seemed really interested in the fact that I had video evidence of the old phone working and he finally offered to let me speak with a supervisor. He claimed the supervisor wasn’t immediately available though and that he would call me back later that day. I never received a call back.
* **5/21/18** – I called in and was transferred to the Order Management Team. I spoke with a rep named Will who said that the case is still open and he promised me he would have a supervisor call me back that day. I told him I just wanted to speak with a supervisor immediately since I didn’t receive a call back last time but he said it wasn’t an option. I reluctantly agreed to wait for a call back. Surprise- I never received a call.

I’m appalled at how horrible Google’s customer service is. I’ve bought several devices from them over the past eight years including a Pixel, Pixel XL, Nexus 6P, Galaxy Nexus, all the way back to my Nexus One. I hate to say it but this is will be last purchase I make from them. I’ve been nothing by loyal to them and I’m blown away that they continue to treat their customers like this. It’s clear that they just don’t care. They’re too big and individual customers clearly don’t matter to them.

So here I am at a complete loss as to what to do. I feel like my only option is to turn to the community for help. Maybe posting it here will help bring my issue to light and get it resolved. u/PixelCommunity are you out there? Anyone from Google Support? I just want you guys to make this right.

**UPDATE 5/22/18**: Thank you everyone for upvoting this and helping it to gain traction. I never expected this kind of support, but I really appreciate this empathy I've received from this community. It worked! I just received an email from Google Support from a rep named **Jules**. She was extremely apologetic about this situation and has gone ahead to issue the remaining refund. I'm honestly stunned at the moment. It's hard to believe that six long weeks of pushing this have finally paid off. Thank you thank you thank you, to the r/GooglePixel community and to Jules. You guys have made my day!

**UPDATE 5/23/18**: I've also been contacted by a Google employee named Jason who has been awesome. He's gone above and beyond to make sure I'm happy and taken care of. Google, if you're listening, **Jules** and **Jason** are fantastic. They deserve all the credit for resolving this and delivering excellent customer service. Please use them as examples for the rest of your teams. They know how to treat customers and deserve to be praised for their efforts. Thanks again!

**UPDATE 6/15/18:** I never expected to be posting an update like this, but I feel I wouldn't be doing Google justice if I didn't. **Jason** and another employee named **Kyle** put together a care package for me. It was completely unnecessary but incredibly kind of them. They sent me a[ few goodies](https://imgur.com/a/xcbgaAJ), including a Google Home Mini, a fabric case for my P2XL, and pair of Pixel Buds!

Woke up to [this](https://imgur.com/YqupSe3) email and was upset enough to come immediately to Reddit. Will likely follow up on Twitter.


Maybe my response wasn't the most appropriate, but it is two days short of six months that they've been giving me the run-around. I have sworn by this phone for the majority of time I've had with it. In June, my battery started being finnicky and my phone would shut down randomly at anywhere from 5% to 15%. I had also recieved numerous reports that my mic was not working correctly and that has only continued to get worse. I can usually only have phone calls over bluetooth now.


So, I contacted live support and they created a ticket for me. I was initially very optimistic, as the representative helping me was incredibly active and attentive in doing what he needed to.

It seemed the issue was that my warranty wasn't being recognized because it wasn't attached to my current device. I'd gotten two replacements-- one, I dropped it and the screen cracked, and then, two, they sent me a replacement that stopped working almost immediately after I got it. They replaced the faulty one immediately and told me it would not count against my device warranty, as it was mailed faulty.


But, my initial representative identified the issue and moved the warranty to my device-- or so he said. I then was assigned a new representative and recieved [this](https://imgur.com/Fr4Ck9n) for the following five months. 

Today, I was told that my warranty was expired and that they could be of no help. [Here](https://imgur.com/xx0qHgE) is a copy of my receipt, showing that my warranty isn't expired. This is included in the very first of [OVER 70 emails](https://imgur.com/XO1GBK3) that we exchanged just trying to get me a phone that I could use to actually call people!

This also indicates that my first support representative did not do what he told me he did and move my warranty.

I am very frustrated. I don't know what to do at this point. I will be opening another ticket and be posting this anywhere online that I can. I hope that someone here could provide guidance, or, better yet, someone from support who is actually willing to resolve my issue sees this. 

I just want a working phone.


TL;DR- Bought warranty with OG Pixel. Wasn't on my account for some reason. Google support said they fixed it. Five months later, they tell me otherwise and close my ticket.


Thanks for reading.


EDIT: First of all, I'd like to thank you guys for all the support. It's *looking like* this is going to get resolved and that's exciting.

u/dmziggy was an immediate help and I wanted to explicitly say that I appreciate their help. I have received a support email, a response here in this thread, and some correspondence through my Reddit Request ticket.

Again, thank you all. I'll keep you updated on what goes on.

Oh, and thanks for the silver! :)


EDIT 2: They have mailed me a replacement and also given me a $50 gift card for my troubles. I'm frustrated that it took so much to get to this point, but I'm happy it's getting resolved.

Google Pixels are wonderful devices, I own one, and I'll be buying the 4 XL in Q4. However, the hardware in the Samsung Galaxy devices is just so much better. The only reason I don't buy Samsung phones is because of the sofware. I don't like OneUI (haters gonna hate), I love stock Android, I love quick updates, I love the smooth snappy nature of my 2 XL.

If Google could bring this, plus all the Pixel-specific stuff to a phone with the hardware of an S10/S10+, then I'd buy it. The better screen, the bigger battery, the build quality, the thin bezels, all of it. It's a shame this would never happen, but we can dream.

I forgot to mention that I'd expect it to keep dual front-firing speakers, and even the two-toned rear design would be fine. Wasn't necessarily talking about the curved edges either.

So please, if you haven't had any trouble, leave a message! This way we can feel what percent of people are having trouble vs those with no trouble and it might make those of us with no trouble a little less anxious that it's going to blow up in our face, maybe literally.

Thank you!

The only trouble I have had was I needed to restart my phone to apply the January patch yesterday, it wouldn't download otherwise, not sure if I can be considered ""trouble free"" or not, but I'm considering it trouble free as the phone hardware seems fine.

edit: i think in the interest of fairness, minor issues will be considered ""no issue"" if they can be easily corrected like okay google not working until you restart the phone, as these kinds of thinks can most likely be corrected in software updates.

The white and pink models didn't visibly scratch easily at all, and the black pixel scratched with a dime but the scratches themselves go away by just holding the phone in your hand.

I did this because I saw people complaining about permanent damage basically out of the box, and I didn't believe it. So now we see that these scratches are cosmetic and literally take no effort whatsoever to wipe away. They are NOT permanent scratching to the ""inferior glass backing"" where Gorilla Glass 5 or whatever would fix, they're not permanent at all.

Your fingernail won't normally leave a mark at all but if you push hard you can make a streak with your nail against the glass, again it wipes away immediately.

Panic attack! I wanted to freak out but also wanted to get my phone back first!

Thanks to the smart phone, I don't remember anybody's phone number. 

I was emailing my SO and suddenly found out in the Google Hangout section you can make phone calls...for free. Also the entire contact list was saved there. 

So I went back to the find-my-phone website, selected ""Play Sound"" (my phone was set to silent), and kept calling myself using Google Hangout. 

Someone picked up the phone after the second try. It was the bus driver. 

Now my phone is safely at the bus station office waiting for me to pick it up during lunch break.

\- OLED screen is really good for a sub $500 phone

\- Stereo Speakers are really good. I like them better than the Pixel 3 XL's. Might not get quite as loud but sound very clear and not as much vibration as the 3XL's. These don't feel like budget speakers.

\- Haptic Feedback is great. I was expecting cheap feeling haptics, maybe tinny feeling but this feels very similar to the 3XL. Came from a Note 9 and its as good or better feeling that the note 9.

\- Size is perfect. Note 9 was too tall for me. 

\- Weight, its lighter but not cheap feeling. With a old 3XL case on it(fits pretty close until I get a proper case) it has the right weight. 

\- Headphone Jack audio sounds very good, similar to the Note 9. Not an audiophile tho so don't quote me but its sounds like the same quality other flagships have.

\- Phone feels fast. Might open apps a little slower than a flagship but its not ""as slow as crap"" like some are saying. I'm sure its not as fast at gaming but its definitely fast for my use case(music, YT, Social Media, Reddit, Chrome, etc)

\- Camera, Awesome, not slow at capturing(HDR processing in the background is a little slower but not really slow or much different). So glad to have a Pixel camera again, the Note 9 is nice and all but taking photos of moving subjects and in lower light conditions is not its best features. 

\- Battery Life, so far hard to tell but seems as good as the note 9 or in between it and the Pixel 3 XL.

\- Buttons, feel well made and durable. Nice clicky buttons. 

\- fingerprint Scanner is great. 

&#x200B;

I am very happy with this phone. I'm really kinda single handedly blown away by how much google fit in this package. They really only skimped on the processor which seems great for my needs to far. I think people are bashing this phone too much when they have no experience actually using it yet. Yes its missing features but things needed cut for the price, and yes I understand you can get some flagships discounted close to this price but this phone is wonderful. I wholeheartedly recommend it so far. I was really on the fence yesterday driving to Best Buy. I was thinking I would regret it. But its the opposite. I'm so glad I did. The Note 9 is wonderful and everything but it just has too many features that get in its own way. Plus I just wanted the best camera on a smartphone and that's the Pixel 3a/3/3xl. Price is such a great value especially at $479 + $100 bonus bringing it to $379.

My previous two phones were iPhone 6 and iPhone 7 which I used for about 4 years total and totaled ~400 pictures each. 

What I think Google got right was reducing the inhibitions of pulling out the phone to take a photo. Compared to my iPhones, I feel like I don't need to be deliberate when taking photos with Pixel 3. Things like not having to worry about storing the photos, means I'm not wasting time deleting bad photos as I take them. Also not having to look at the screen to open the camera app allows me to ready the camera without missing the moment with my own eyes. Rather than pulling out the camera only on special occasions, the Pixel justifies taking more photos of my surroundings and experimenting. It's a better user experience.

I ordered a Pixel on Dec 2, 2018 and received confirmation that the phone would be shipped on January 4, 2019.  I went out of town over the holidays and returned January 1 to an email stating that my phone had been delivered on the 28th of Dec. Only problem? No phone was at my house. 

I called Google and they identified that FedEx had said it was successfully delivered and gave me the name of the person who signed for it . I shared that this was not my name (which they knew) and that I was thousands of miles away when the phone was theoretically delivered. Additionally, the phone was delivered 6 days prior to when it was initially reported to be delivered and I was not provided with any updates information alerting me that it was going to be shipped.  Google said they would ""make sure I was taken care of"", would investigate, and would get back to me.  

After multiple attempts at getting updates, Google finally responds two weeks later stating that they are closing my case because FedEx confirmed that the phone was successfully delivered. I escalated and was told that a supervisor would look further into it. 

A few days later I am told that because my case was already closed and FedEx confirmed delivery there's nothing they can do. I call back to yet another customer support person and am told that I need to contact FedEx.  I do so. 

FedEx chats me with me and shares that they will investigate and get back to me. I wait a few days and FedEx finally reports back that it was a seasonal worker who delivered the package. They  identify that there isn't anything they can do, but note that they will mark my package as ""package unable to be found."" They tell me that Google must file a claim as the shipper. 

I call Google back with this information and am told that they will file a claim with FedEx.  I am promised information in 2 days. 3 days later, I email back to see what the status is. Google emails back and shares that because I had already escalated and found that the package was successfully delivered I must open the claim with FedEx myself. Now remember,  FedEx already told me that I couldn't do this. 

This is starting to be entirely ridiculous.  I call Google again,  explain the situation and ask if we can call FedEx together. They say they'll look into it. I get an email a few days later (again) that there's nothing they can do.

 I call back, explain the situation .again . and they finally agree to call FedEx with me. We make a plan to do so the next day when the support person can get the right individual on the line. 

Which brings us to today, a month after the phone was ""lost."" I call FedEx again on my own ahead of time and they give me a reference number for the lost package.  The customer support person from Google  then calls me 30 minutes after we had agreed to chat and says, ""oh yeah, hey, sorry. Because you already had an escalation which resulted in us finding the package was successfully delivered there nothing we can do. File a claim with FedEx."" 

Wtf do I do? I feel like I'm talking in circles and don't know what other recourse I have at this point. FedEx won't let me file a claim and Google won't reach back out to FedEx (despite me giving them the lost package reference number from FedEx as well).

google,694,2019-03-08 16:32:00,IcarusFox,S10 review from Pixel user,"Would there be any interest in a review on the s10 from a frequent Pixel user?

I know a lot of us are frustrated by the latest bugs as well as the lackluster delivery of the 3. And although the March update had fixed many issues I feel many of us are looking to test the waters on other devices.

I'm no MKBHD, but I have used all 3 Pixel devices, having been consistently on Pixel since my 2XL. I've also tested the 3XL against the iPhone XS Max and Note 9 previously. So now having an opportunity to test the S10+ I have the chance to give an honest review from a Pixel user perspective.

Would anyone be interested in a full review? I just received mine yesterday so it would be at least a week or more to get the full experience.

TLDR; I'm a full time Pixel user with an S10+ and want to do a review.

EDIT: Since this post is starting to really gain traction, are there any areas that you guys would like to focus on? The main areas I'm planning on currently are: screen, camera, battery, UI, customization, settings, performance (this will include speed, memory leaks, apps force closing, and responsiveness), Samsung vs Google apps (such as pay, bixby, etc), and general impressions.

I'll test anything you guys are interested in knowing.

EDIT2: Damn this post has really blown up. I won't let you guys down. I'm expecting to write the review by or around next Saturday. Since I'm a heavy user I expect to have a good idea by then. I'll update this post with a link to the review once it's done. Thanks to everyone for the encouragement and support. Nice to know a lot of people feel the same as me.

google,664,2018-11-17 17:05:43,scootter82,How I traded up to a Pixel 3 for free. Actually got some money back!,"So first off, you should know if you buy major electronics with your AMEX or CITI card, they will extend the manufacturer warranty by a year (two for Citi).

I bought my OG Pixel XL new around Feb 2017.  So the manufacturer warranty expired March 2018.  Amex warranty then started.  A few months back, my Quick Charge stopped working, and I noticed my Android Auto would disconnect often.  So I started the Amex Warranty process.  It's very simple!  They had me fill out a few forms, then take the phone to an authorized repair facility (ubreakifix).  They looked at the phone, said Google doesn't provide replacement mother boards for the USB C port, and they couldn't repair it.  Got that printed on a sheet and submitted to AMEX.  About a week and a half later, a credit showed up on my AMEX account for the original purchase price of $894! 

While this process was ongoing, I went ahead and ordered a Pixel 3 and selected the trade in option.  Amex didn't require me to send my OG Pixel anywhere!  So I paid for the new P3 with my AMEX.  My P3 came in about a week after my AMEX credit hit my account.  Perfect!

Just this past week, I received  emails stating my $50 credit from the P3 purchase promotion was in my account.  I also got an email stating Google received my OG P XL and would be crediting my AMEX $150.  

So there was an initial entry cost, but I basically was able to trade up for free, and receive $200 in credit.  I'll probably hold on to this phone for another few years and see if I can keep this train going.

Edit:  I also want to say I was surprised that I got the full $154 for my OG XL.  There was a very hard to see hairline fracture on the front, many scuffs and dings on the sides, and the back glass by the camera was smashed to shit, even whole flakes missing.  I sent it in, in my former wallet case.  Checked the ""Screen turns on and no cracks"" checkbox.

google,638,2018-12-05 18:15:35,xrossfader,Switching to Pixel was the best decision I've made.,"Hey,

I've come from a Note8 and before that I was an Apple user since iPhone 1. So, here it is...

**The Phone:**

I've never felt a phone *feel* as good as the Pixel in my hands. I'm an average sized man with dainty computer hands, as my wife puts it, and the phone fits. Its edges all merry to one another and the transitions are seamless. This makes the everyday pickup, use, hold, put away, fumble, twirl of my phone like no other. The construction of it feels really solid but it doesn't feel like some hard piece of hardware in my pocket. The overall size of the Pixel 3 is perfect for typing on one hand if needed and even reaching across the full screen when I'm one handing it in my offhand. 

Coming from the Note 8 I was a little worried about the screen but it's honestly the best screen I've looked at. Its gorgeous. Its bright. its colors aren't over saturated or over processed. It seems to reproduce visuals with sensitivity to the content you're viewing. The Note 8 over processed its colors and I had to go in and change many things to get it to feel right. Or just neutral and balanced. 

The buttons click with satisfaction. The fingerprint sensor is perfectly placed. its such a natural position. When I grab my phone I don't even realize that my finger is already right next to or over the sensor. Its so perfect. 

The speakers... I'm actually astonished at how well they reproduce clear sound without distortion that you normally hear from that annoying person on your commute home. They aren't overly bright and tinny, they feel right for their size. We're not talking crazy bass or anything like that but you won't be annoyed by them by any means when you're using your phone to listen to some tunes while you clean a room. They're fairly loud and that is also pretty cool. 

**The accessories:** 

I actually really enjoy the pixel buds. I know... call me crazy but the ability to adjust the size of the little hoops that keep the headphones in my ears is fantastic. They also sound really great. I mean, I have DT 770 pros and I do live audio mixing and so on and for headphones that you get as an accessory to your phone, they really have fantastic sound. They don't try to color your sound or change it to fake anything. They stay true to, as close to true, as the recording that you're listening to. They also don't' hurt the ear after extended use. I kind of forget they're in my ears. This is particularly nice on commutes and just cruising around. No, they are not going to noise cancel. They let in your atmosphere and I'm ok with this. I want to hear the world around me a bit so I can be aware of my surrounding. Bonus: they plug in via USB-C and integrate with Assistant. You can program your voice for assistant with the headphones specifically. Thats great! I wish more headphones did this. 

The rapid charger is crazy fast. The dongle for standard 1/8 headphone jack is a nice to have and the USB-USB-C adapter is always appreciated so I can plugin whatever I want into my pixel. 

**The OS:**

I thought iOS was good. Even superior to Android but I was so limited on how I wanted my phone to function. I switched and I felt free. So so free of the walls that Apple had built around me. Absolutely freeing. I don't even know how to explain it but I just felt happy. 

Android on a Note 8 is a bit bloated. So I had to do all I could to configure the device, which was great that I could, to make it more like stock Android with some awesome custom skins and all that but some of the Samsung stuff just kept popping up. I wish I could just remove it all but manufacturers are just not going to let you do that. Bummer. 

Stock Android is so crisp and clean. It's warm and homey. its the invitation I think all Apple users need to finally see how amazing this OS is. I love how everything is at your fingertips. I can move stuff around and make it mine. The Notifications are easily the best thing on Android, IMO. I can read, reply and see everything clearly. I know just by the icon what app is trying to get my attention. I love this. The way that the AOD utilizes simple icons to give you a glanceable overview of life is a thing of beauty. The simple readout of a notification or calendar invite is so easily digested that it doesn't derail you from whatever you were doing. 

The OS is made for you. Its made for you to feel like you're not trying to use an OS. It's not designed with the intent of making you do things a specific way and only that way. I love that. It's a relief to know I own what this software is going to feel like for me.

**Project Fi:**

I jumped boats and I couldn't be happier. The thought that my bill will never exceed X, no matter where I roam or how I use it is fantastic. The fact that it utilizes multiple networks to find the best signal is brilliant. I've had fantastic coverage everywhere and I don't even feel like I've had any blank spots. I mean... if you really wanted to I bet you could keep your phone bill down to like $25-$30 a month. Yup. I said it. It's totally possible. All depends on how you want to configure your lifestyle. Knowing that I'm paying for the MB's, yes MB's, I'm using vs just charging me for an extra GB is amazing. I shouldn't have to pay for what I don't use. If you're considering switching, ping and I think I have some sort of referral that hooks us both up. 

**TL:DR - Conclusion.**

Stop thinking about it. The Pixel 3 is the best daily driver for common use. If you're on the fence, jump over with open arms and run through a warm field of happy thoughts knowing you're joining a culture of free thinkers. An experience that isn't structured but designed to be made into your own experience. Rejoice! You'll be happy made the leap in more than one way. 

Got a question? Ping. Happy to answer. Cheers peeps!

google,632,2018-09-15 03:58:53,ego-sum-deus,"When my OG Pixel is ready to be retired, I may be abandoning the Pixel ship. Please allow me to share my perspective. Let's discuss.","I've been exclusively using Android and Google products since 2008, and I've really enjoyed the experience. Google has always felt like the forefront of powerful, configurable, and usable software, and with the introduction of the Pixel on Android 8, I genuinely felt content and loved the Android experience as seen through Google's eyes. The hardware felt right, amazing camera, smooth and user friendly software, and I could use the phone and software exactly as I saw fit.

However, things feel different now.

First, what is up with Android 9? I'm genuinely shocked at how many things have changed, and a lot of it seems like changes for changes sake; removal of WiFi/bluetooth quick settings menu, volume slider being changed, gestures are terrible, the recent apps screen feeling clunky, along with many other changes that seem like unnecessary feature cutting. I love software updates and generally look forward to them, but with Android 9, the direction feels off and the changes have no good replacements/solutions.

Also, how can essential apps be abandoned or neglected so often and so quickly? Hangouts being abandoned for the general user, messaging being a total mess, Inbox going away, and apps just generally being introduced and then abandoned without explanation or direct, better replacements. This concept of being introduced to software, just to be taken away some time in the future, is getting tiresome. I want to also point out Android Auto here, because it falls directly into this category of breaking often and being neglected, but I won't expand further because it's off topic.

Hardware. The headphone jack is a non-negotiable for me. I have expensive wired headphones that I use literally all day; so, I just can't listen and charge my phone at the same time anymore? That's it? Or I have to use terrible quality, spotty connection bluetooth now on new headphones? I have to rely on a dongle that is shoddy construction with high failure rates? Ok. If that's Google's answer for me now, their vision of mobile functionality does not align with me anymore. I guess I'll have to find hardware elsewhere.

The recent battery saver mishap. I'm surprised this isn't a bigger deal in the Android blogs and news sites. I'm okay with Google being able to push server side changes. Hell, I'm even okay with Google doing something like this as a test of a new feature (although less thrilled about it). But to have this happen, with absolutely no notification or announcement is craziness. I have the OS configured exactly how I want it, and if Google wants to change that configuration, at least let the user know that it happened. I missed important notifications due to this battery saver change, and to me, that's completely unacceptable. I simply cannot trust my phone anymore knowing that system settings will be changed without my knowledge. Again, if this is Google's vision moving forward with Android, I guess it's not for me.

Finally, I actually never saw this day coming. I guess I was naive, but after getting the OG Pixel, I really did think that I'd be sticking around the Pixel ecosystem for a looong time. With everything that has changed the last couple years, I just can't envision a path forward with the Pixel, and potentially even Android, anymore. That's really disappointing. I don't want to move on, but it's becoming increasingly clear that Google's vision of hardware and software just doesn't line up with what I feel like is a user friendly, stable, and interesting mobile experience anymore.

TLDR - I'm not finding myself aligning with Google's vision anymore. Please read the above though because I want other perspectives.

Edit -

Ummmmm, wow. I was not expecting this many responses. I just got a chance to really sit down and look at what others have said, and I have to say, I'm quite shocked at how many people are resonating with what I originally outlined. I honestly did not expect to bring these things up and uncover what seems to be an underlying and growing frustration within the Pixel community. Maybe I've been out of the loop, or maybe I've been avoiding the inevitable disappointment, but I really am sad to see I'm not alone here.

I know it won't happen, but I'd love to hear the perspective of a Google Community Director or someone about this. My intent with the post revolves around trying to understand how and why things got this way within the Pixel/Android ecosystem. Part of me is still grasping to the point that all of this may still be salvageable, if I just had visibility into the overall direction and reasoning behind the evolution; but I'm not hopeful I'll get that chance. If Android devs or community liaisons see this, please don't be afraid to address the community. A lot of us are here with genuine intent (and a love for Android) and are willing to listen with respectful and constructive insight.

Finally, I probably won't get the chance to respond to most of the replies, but I will be spending the evening reading through everyone's comments. This post wasn't just to complain or vent, and I'm curious to see what others have to say. I've been a member of other open source communities thoughout my life, and I'm totally willing to change my perspective and expectations if I'm presented with reasonable and fair rebuttals; hell, I welcome the opportunity to be convinced differently than where I'm at now. Depending on my availability, I may even try to compile a list of the common threads, including both positive and negative opinions.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9fyly0/when_my_og_pixel_is_ready_to_be_retired_i_may_be/

24 days total but only 3 days after posting here on Reddit and filling out a Reddit request and sharing on FB and Twitter, and sharing the post with the Google customer service representative, I have been issued a refund for the phone. They couldn't send me a replacement device because they did not currently have any in stock, and instead of dragging this out longer I chose the refund. I thank everyone one who shared their experiences and tried to help, and for the people who said its useless posting stuff like this here are wrong, It clearly helps draw attention to common issues a company has but do not admit they are common issues. It also gives people another avenue to pursue when their current options have stalled. I wont be 100% satisfied until I see the money back in my account which could take up to 10 business days.

I ordered a Pixel 3 XL for my wife's birthday, it arrived after an erroneous shipping delay and on a day that wasn't scheduled by FedEx ground, We signed for the package opened it up and there was no phone inside. Upon closer examination of the package you could see where it was cut open with a box cutter and re-taped. I immediately contacted Google and was told they would get back to me the next business day with the steps I would need to do to resolve the matter.  A few minutes later I received an email from Google support saying that there was nothing they could do and they fulfilled their part of of the transaction and they recommend I contact local law enforcement. Ofcourse I called back because this was not true they had not fulfilled their part of the transaction because I did not have a device in my package meaning it was taken by FedEx or someone at the Google fulfillment center (something that could have maybe been prevented by security tape which all major companies and carriers use instead of clear box tape like Google uses). Anyways after I called back I was issued a Case ID took pictures of the packaging , digitally signed a declaration that the package was empty and was told there would be an investigation. After 3 days I follow up because they said it usually takes about 3 days, no update, I follow up at 7 days no updates,  10 days no update. I call back an on the phone over an hour no update , they tell me they can't issue a replacement or refund until there is an update, I ask why it is taking so long no answer, today is 21 days since I reported this incident, no resolution in sight, I'm extremely dissatisfied customer service is non-existent, have several Google products and may just trade it all in over this.

google,606,2018-12-03 00:43:02,studioviper,Here's a really quick & easy camera trick for interesting / dramatic wide angle shots,"This is what it looks like - https://photos.app.goo.gl/gL1JVvHB9SYctp41A

This is how to achieve it -

1) activate the front facing camera

2) the person taking the photo holds the phone with the top edge of the phone touching the ground, so that the camera lens is only a few millimetres from the floor

3) the person taking the photo stands behind the phone with the  screen facing the subject. The person taking the photo bends down to look at the screen to check the composition, but ensuring that they aren't in frame

4) once the shot is lined up, shoot a few snaps

Variation - instead of having someone else take the photo, lay the phone on the floor with a jacket or something underneath so you can easily adjust the angle. Put the camera in timer mode (3 sec delay), fire the shutter and get everyone in to position for an unusual selfie (this is how we did the Ferris wheel photo.

This is why its such a useful technique -

1) the front camera is a much wider angle than the rear camera, so you can fit a lot more into the field of view (great for big buildings etc in the background)


2) placing the top of the phone parallel with the ground ensures that you always get level photos


3) facing the camera screen at the subject allows them to position themselves better (like you can when taking a selfie)


4) having the camera low on the floor can produce dramatic results and is an unusual perspective that's hard to do in the traditional way (unless you lie on the floor, but who wants to do that?!). 


Here's why you probably shouldn't use it all the time -

1) the angle is sometimes unflattering - tends to work better if the subject is further away

2) mix it up - this is just another tool in your arsenal - don't over-do it!


Hope this helps / inspires!

Edit - thanks for all the nice comments and feedback :) I added a photo of my gfs 4 year old cousin to the album. I think this technique works well on animals and kids because it's generally better to take shots from their perspective (or close to).",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/a2j9x0/heres_a_really_quick_easy_camera_trick_for/
google,610,2019-05-11 13:27:36,Mr_Mojo_Risin_,The Pixel 3a has reshaped how I look at smart phones.,"I've been an Android power user since day one. Always buying the top of the line phone every two years. I didn't hesitate paying $950 for my Note 8. I full on intended to buy the Note 10, even with the likely huge price tag. 

Unfortunately I just recently cracked my Note 8's screen and back glass. So instead of paying $200-300 to get it fixed, I bought a 3a yesterday and will sell my Note for parts. I'm in love with this thing for all the reasons everyone been talking about. 

Now, I cringe thinking about buying a ~$1000 phone when this $400 one is SO good! It just feels irresponsible to pay so much more money for not that much more functionallity. I really hope Google continues this line of killer budget phones.

google,607,2019-05-04 01:51:41,Trueray17,Solved Pixel 3/3XL Performance Issues,"So, I have literally spent months trying different methods in attempts of fixing the Pixel 3 sluggishness and stuttering issues. I tried reboots, uninstalling unwanted apps, clearing the cache, full system wipes, etc but no matter what the performance issues would return.  A few days ago  I stared at my pixel 3 just confused why is performance so terrible, I personally don't believe it's the lack of ram but software related. I asked myself what is the last big feature that Google added to Android Pie?! Just maybe that is the culprit. Then, Digital Wellbeing came in to mind. So I went in to my settings clicked on Digital Wellbeing, clicked the 3 dots on the top right and turned off usage access. Disabling digital Wellbeing from tracking apps and data. After that, my phone has been butter smooth not one stutter or lag. Switching between apps is a breeze now, no more text input lag just speedy performance throughout the whole UI. Also, if you reduce animations in developer options it's a whole new experience (blazing fast). I highly recommend everyone who is experiencing performance issues (sluggishness, lag, stutters) throughout the UI to disable digital Wellbeing. Let us know if it fixed the performance issues and spread the word.

Best regards,

@Trueray17


Update: It's been a week and with the workaround performance has been exceptional.

google,595,2019-03-04 04:13:55,VexxedFox89,After five months....the Pixel 3 is a woefully mediocre smartphone attached to an amazing industry setting camera.,"Before I'm crucified at the cross by some, I have been a Pixel 3 owner since launch (proof: [https://imgur.com/a/0fbacQA](https://imgur.com/a/0fbacQA)) and overall I have enjoyed my time with the phone. It is rather snappy, compact, and overall an decently enjoyable experience for the average cellphone user, however for the price it's not worth the cost of admission especially for someone that's more tech inclined than the average consumer.

1.) QA issues for days. We have seen the posts on here by many people. Some devices needing to be sent in. Cameras crashing on startup (the largest selling point of the Pixel 3) still not being fixed, abysmal RAM management that seems to get better then worse and just doesn't compare to the levels we expect from a flagship phone.

&#x200B;

2.) Unacceptable bugs. I expect bugs in my phone and in all software really but some of the bugs on the Pixel 3 are glaringly bad. Photos not saving on launch was a tad overblown by the community but it still was an issue that never should have made it launch (in fact it almost cost me $150 at my job because the receipt images did not save even though multiple were taken...thankfully I also took the pictures on my work iPhone). However phantom notifications are something that still plague the Pixel 3, wherein the user receives the notification sound or vibration and there is nothing on the screen to show a notification. I have never experienced this on another phone.

&#x200B;

Now some of these are minor and people may think, ""what's the big deal, as you said all phones have problems"" however there is one ""bug"" that has caused me to swap out the Pixel3 for the 10e...screenshots. I have received MANY notifications that a screenshot has been taken when the phone is just lying on the table with no interaction and when I check my phone there is nothing on the screen nor in the notification panel though the AOD clearly showed that a screenshot was captured. I cannot find these screenshots. They are not in my folders nor are they in the cloud, but they clearly have been saved somewhere without my consent and that's unacceptable .

&#x200B;

Lastly, before this gets too long....

3.) Bluetooth. Audio is huge for me and I love music and Audible and with the Pixel 3 lacking a headphone jack (which I don't mind, I have Airpods, Jabra 65t, and AKGs) it is important that it has good bluetooth. Boy is that a sore spot for the Pixel 3. Compared to the iPhone X I came from and the Galaxy S8 before that the audio quality on the Pixel 3 is laughable. Volume doesn't get remotely high enough and the lack of ""umph"" (for a lack of words) in the quality of the music and audio over Bluetooth is just sad (though to its credit it's not just Bluetooth, the wired Pixelbuds that came with the phone are just as lackluster with sound). But I'm going to pick on Bluetooth here because there have been \*numerous times\* the bluetooth has decided to just turn itself off with absolutely no interaction from me. I'm not saying accidental touches in my pocket or in the cup holder, I mean legit just switched off while the phone was locked and no being interacted with. That is unacceptable.

&#x200B;

I have enjoyed the Pixel 3 overall but after it's been all said and done, with the 10e around the corner offering a replacement for the ""compact"" phone, it's time to take the Pixel 3 to the farm as some of these problems are getting worse and worse and Google Support has been all but useless on some of them.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/ax2si4/after_five_monthsthe_pixel_3_is_a_woefully/

This is probably less than half of what came out, most of the crud fell to the floor.  The dust/dirt really gets compressed in there and just when I thought I was done, I'd pull up another big ball of crud.  I've only had the phone since April.  

The toothpick from a small Swiss Army knife was the perfect tool for this.  It's plastic, thin, and flexible enough to go around the ends.  I've read elsewhere that a can of compressed air is helpful too, but as compressed/compacted as my dust was, I'm not sure that would have helped.

Imagine if to use the flash you had to do this. UX designers solved this in digital cameras decades ago!

How it should work is that it should be in the Flash setting UI at the top, a 4th option after auto flash. A little A beside the night icon labelled 'Night Mode auto'.

Then when it's very dark, instead of using flash it should use night mode... automatically. No separate tab, just in the main camera.

* The speakers sound very nice, it felt like I was listening to something on my laptop
* Transferring my old data took less than 30 minutes and was incredibly simple. I was surprised by how thorough is was, even stuff like contact photos were already set up for me
* The UI is so much more intuitive for me, and there are so many quality of life improvements in the UI that I honestly can't count them (coming from a PC guy, not a mac person)
* My only 'complaint' is that the screen seems slightly orange/yellow coming off of another device (since I personally like a cooler display), but it's only noticeable on the device itself if I'm trying hard to find it

I know I'm comparing it to a phone from 4-5 years ago, but I couldn't tell you the difference between the 3a and my coworker's new X. If you're like me and have an older phone, you'll legitimately feel like you own a flagship if you get this. I'm the only person in my family that has ever bought a phone other than an iphone, but after only a day of seeing it everyone wants one too.

google,544,2019-05-12 21:29:04,TheGnaa,The Pixel 3a XL is a true 2 day phone - First overall impressions,"I pulled the trigger on a Pixel 3a XL and so far I am so happy with this phone. These are my impressions after one and a half day of usage.

The **battery life** of my Pixel 3a XL impressed me the most. This will be at least a 2 day phone with my usage and could even last 3 days with medium usage. I never had a Nexus/Pixel with such great battery life. Today I mostly used it for texting, browsing Reddit, Twitter and a 2 news apps. A bit of Camera and listening to music aswell.

EDIT: People are wondering why the camera is my ""most used"" app with 9 minutes. The list is sorted by battery consumption, not usage time. I used Reddit, Twitter and news apps for much longer (30-60 Minutes each), they just don't show up on the list because they consumed less power than the camera.

Battery stats after a 15 hour day: https://i.imgur.com/bIVgvhG.png

The **screen** is alright, but not mind blowing. It is as bright as my Pixel 3, but has got less grain. Viewing angles are a bit worse on the 3a XL. Color uniformity is great. So overall an okay display for the price, but don't expect a high end Samsung panel.

The **speakers** are okay, the maximum volume is on the lower side, my Pixel 3 gets louder. But most importantly, the quality is alright, no issues like with the Pixel 3 XL speakers.

**Performance** is great so far, I don't play games on my phone, so I don't need a hight end SoC. I didn't notice any differences compared to my Pixel 3.

**Camera quality** is the exact same as my Pixel 3. I compared different photos and I can't spot any differences. Only the image processing takes a bit longer on the Pixel 3a XL of course.

**Build quality** is good, the plastic body feels quite nice, not cheap at all. The vibration motor is nice, close to the Pixel 3 but not as good and louder.

Headphone jack is nice, but I miss wireless charging and official waterproofing. I think Google should have at least included wireless charging to make the 3a line compatible with the Pixel stand.

All in all I am very happy with the 3a XL and don't miss my ""more premium"" Pixel 3. I love it to be back on a bigger phone. The Pixel 3 XL was not option because of the hideous notch and the broken speakers.

**Tldr:**
Amazing battery life and great camera, good performance, speakers and build quality, headphone jack, screen is good but could be brighter, I miss waterproofing and wireless charging.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/bnufm9/the_pixel_3a_xl_is_a_true_2_day_phone_first/

google,541,2018-11-22 09:34:16,gjg650,Loyal iPhone user. Switched to a Pixel 3 XL tonight. My thoughts...,"It hit -20 in Toronto tonight, so I dedicated my evening to the couch in order to disect this phone.

I'm beyond happy with my choice and can't believe I never gave the pixel a serious look until the past few weeks leading up to my purchase. 

Hardware: I still prefer the iPhone X, however the pixel still managed to really impressed me. I have the black model and it looks beautiful. The pixel doesn't have that cheap feel that some Android's have. 

Operating system/interface:  I was initially turned off from iOS when I realized how messy the screens are. It's a clutter of tiled apps that have been the standard since apple released their first phone. As for the pixel, im a HUGE fan of the organization capabilities. I only have 3 home pages and they're all simple yet efficient. No clutter, rather apps and widgets that I commonly use on the fly.  I could go on far more about the guts of this phone, but I'll conclude this segment by saying that if you enjoy deep customization, get a pixel. I understand this has been the classic android/iOS difference for a long time, but the pixel has been the first non-iOS device that blew me away with responsiveness, fluididty, and speed. 

Lastly, Google and it's role in the phone. I logged into my Google account while setting the phone up, and boom... My extensive use of Gmail, youtube, maps, and chrome - seamlessly set the phone up totally  personalized for me. I had live updates of the Raptors score on my news feed without downloading a single app. Distance and traffic updates towards work were already set up perfectly. Super impressed.  To get the most out of Google, I'd highly recommend going to Google's official apps available on the store. There's a ton of great apps available for free. 

Camera: Just wow.

I'm very happy with my pixel, and I'm glad I made the switch. The only downside to this device was discovering Google Lens after consuming an edible. My mind is, and still is blown. Lens is unbelievable as it is, however I'm even more excited to see how complex it can get. 

Cheers Pixel users!  

Please let me know below of any cool tips and tricks.

I think people look for the""perfect"" phone...but this is technology, and I don't think anything is really perfect with technology.

I recently returned a defective white pixel 3, so that I could re purchase a not pink model. Problem is, I was only refunded $80 (tax) I'm still owed $900 by Google.


With the shipping is my not pink model, Google screwed up and shipped me 10... At $1000ea, that's $10k of product I now legally have in my possession. In all, I'm actually in the positive by $8k.


Well, I want to do the right thing and return them. But I'm not willing to do so until my refund is processed properly. If I don't get the proper support here, I'll going to attempt to return the extra 9 phones via $1000 COD. If the shipment is rejected, I'll be selling them to recoup my money that wasn't refunded. Again, not the right thing to do but I've run out of patience and options.

The 6t has integrated gestures which rock, the bezels and notch are perfect, and the phone is overall a great device. Google Camera is, of course, better, but marginally.

The OnePlus underscreen fingerprint reader works incredibly well and they also have face unlock for the best of both worlds. 

Overall, for $580 for the 6T (which came with a case and screen protector) and $899 for the 3 XL (which came with a huge notch) I think that the 6T is the winner of this comparison, just as soon as you skin it out to look exactly like the XL. Google's devices feel much better on the software and chassis side but also are made by Google which means they're always going to be prone to Googleisms. 

Really, though. At $400 less with real gesture controls and a solid feeling experience, the future of Android pricing might just be saved thanks to OnePlus. 

Edit: take your Pixel XL or another old phone to T-Mobile and they'll give you $300 off, making this a $280 phone. Crazy! 

Edit 2: the 3XL still has dual front facing cameras though so it's obviously light years ahead of the 6t. Unfortunately, I'm not a model so I can't take advantage of the wide angle selfies with all of my hot friends.

The pixel should not have the problems and level of customer support it does for such an expensive device. I think we all know this, but we all stay because 'the camera', 'the google experience' and some of the other features the pixel series offers.


The fact that this device has SO many problems compared to devices like the Oneplus 6t is ridiculous. I know half the sub denies this and swears ""my pixel is amazing"", but if you seriously use a oneplus 6t for a full week the performance is so much better. The camera is the only thing that truly holds me off from switching to the oneplus 6t.


Not only does the pixel have performance problems though the customer support is TERRIBLE. I recently had an issue where part of the oleophobic coating was missing from the screen. It took ONE MONTH without my pixel 3XL to get this fixed. Thank God, I hadn't sold my pixel 2 yet or I wouldn't have even had a phone for a whole month. Compare this to my Microsoft Surface Pro 6 where I took it into the store because of an issue, was given drinks while I waited 30minutes for a specialist. Was out the store with a brand new unit in no time. They didn't question me, or anything. They had absolutely 0 issue replacing my device on the spot for me.

The initial delivery date was October 18, but it never arrived, so I figured I'd get it the next day. The next day, the package never came, and the shipping date was eventually marked as Pending. I still didn't receive it that Saturday, so the following Monday I contacted FedEx to see what was up. It turned out that FedEx Home Delivery didn't deliver on Mondays, so the person put in charge of the claim that customer support opened said they would contact me at a later date. But they never did.

&#x200B;

The following Wednesday (10/24), I got an email saying that the package was delivered on 10/18, shortly after I left for work, but around the time my mom got home. As far as I'm aware, my area doesn't have any history of package theft. I contacted FedEx again, but all they did was insist that the package was already delivered and eventually just opened another claim. I contacted Google support and they also insisted that the package was already delivered on 10/18 and said they would look into it. 2 weeks later and still no update.

&#x200B;

I just contacted FedEx and Google customer support  again, but the agent I got from FedEx was ""reading chat transcripts"" for so long that they were immediately disconnected and the Google support agent just ""bumped"" the previous case to bring it to the top and to notify the person I previously talked to.

&#x200B;

I still have the chat transcripts from the first 2 times I talked to FedEx support, but I didn't screenshot or save anything from the first time I talked to Google support.

I probably haven't done myself and favors by letting it sit for so long, but what are my options?

To add to that, due to Google's corner cutting when it came to the accessories, the adapters break CONSTANTLY and constantly need replacing. I'm currently on my 3rd adapter which Google has replaced for me due to faults.

After approving my RMA request for a new one TWO MONTHS ago they are STILL out of stock on new ones, and have told me to wait until October for them to be back in again. Why is this a thing??? 

I know I can buy a Razer one or whatever, but I paid Apple level money for this phone, and therefore I expect Apple level service.

At a point the novelty of stock Android is not good enough for this terrible customer service. God help Google when the 3XL comes out.

EDIT: Had a new chat with a Google support rep. The original RMA request was not submitted properly. When I was told a few weeks later that it was out of stock after messaging about their silence, that second rep forgot to check that the RMA request was fully completed, which is why I still haven't received mine.

google,479,2019-03-13 12:30:20,xTeCnOxShAdOwZz,Let's talk about the future of Pixel,"Hello folks, having lurked on this subreddit for quite a while now, I'd like to discuss the direction Pixel is headed.

I have a Pixel 2XL, and I love it. In fact, I've convinced my girlfriend, best friend and another friend to switch to the 2 XL. (2/3 of them were iPhone users). I also convinced 2 other friends to get the Pixel 3 (non-XL), who were both  iPhone users. I love the Pixel line, and I hope this shows it.

However, this last year has not been too good for the Pixel brand. Let's go over it.Memory management has been abysmal on the 3/XL. I'm not sure what they changed compared to the 2 XL (which doesn't seem to suffer these problems), but they should have just done the same thing as before. 4Gb is clearly not enough, everyone knows it. OnePlus having been offering 6Gb since the OnePlus 3, and Samsung now include 6Gb in the base model of the S10E. The argument that Google can simply replicate performance in software is demonstrably limited. The Pixel 4 should have 6Gb/8Gb of RAM (depending on storage config, which we'll talk about in a moment), and the Pixel 4 XL should have 8Gb of RAM. There's no excuse for such little RAM these days. The Pocofone F1 also had 6Gb of RAM, and that's a $300 phone, so the excuse that it increases the price too much is incorrect.

OnePlus and Samsung now start their storage at 128Gb (with Samsung also offering expandable storage). The idea that because we have unlimited original quality photo backup to justify the 64Gb storage option simply doesn't fly in 2019. Why does Google assume it's only photos that take up storage? Although 64Gb is usually okay for me, I don't see why other brands can offer more storage as the base model, for a cheaper price. Apps and games can easily push this to the limit. I have Netflix and YouTube premium, which means I can download content to watch while travelling, but 64Gb is a limitation for me. I think the Pixel 4 & 4 XL should come in 128Gb and 256Gb. Pixel 4 128Gb should come with 6Gb of RAM, whilst the 256Gb model should come with 8Gb of RAM. As I said before, the Pixel 4 XL should have 8Gb of RAM regardless. This is just my opinion, please feel free to disagree in the comments.

Battery. The 3XL has a smaller battery than the 2XL, despite having more pixels to push - the 3 XL has 2.7% more pixels, but the battery is 2.6% smaller. Did they make a mistake and go the wrong way?! The S10+ has a 4,100 MaH battery, many Huawei phones are above the 4000 mark, even the OnePlus 6T has a 3700 MaH battery. Again, Google's philosophy that it doesn't need the best hardware because it can be matched in software is not good enough. The battery life on the 3XL is simply not as good as on other phones, period. Apple has the ability to say that, Google does not. The Pixel 4 should have a 3,100 MaH battery (same as S10E), and the Pixel 4 XL should have at least a 3800 MaH battery (that's being generous).

The design of the Pixel 3(XL) is actually not too bad. The glass on the back feels nice, and it feels a premium. However, if you hold a Samsung or iPhone of the same price, it suddenly feels less premium. This is subjective, I'd like to hear what you think. There's not much to say about the notch on the 3 XL except that it needs to go on the 4 XL. Either a small notch (like OnePlus 6), teardrop notch (like OnePlus 6T) or hole-punch (like Samsung S10). The bezels should also be shrunk, my 2 XL feels a bit silly compared to the likes of some phones, but please please make sure the front-facing speakers are retained. Just shrink them as much as possible whilst keeping the speakers please (one of the best things about Pixel IMO).

Let's talk cameras. Again, Google uses the philosophy that what can be done in hardware can be done in software. To their credit, they have proven this in the camera department, I don't need to talk about how amazing they are at this. They still use just a single rear camera, which is fine. However, there are dual cameras on the front of the 3(XL), \*proving\* that they are aware some things are just done better with multiple cameras. It's kind of a cool gimmick to say 'hey, look what we can do with just a single camera', but please, it's old, just throw a second camera on the back and you'll reclaim your position as camera king. We get it, you can do a lot with a single camera, but if the user experience is better with dual cameras, then please just do it. A wide-angle or telephoto would be great, or just something to make portrait photos even better. Regardless, dual front and back cameras are necessary for the Pixel 4 (XL).

Obviously it'll have waterproofing and wireless charging, so that's fine, and please please keep the squeeze for assistant, I can't live without it.

In screen finger-print scanners are cool, but unless you can make something significantly faster than what's in the OnePlus 6T and S10(+), please just keep the rear fingerprint scanner. It's so much faster, more convenient, and swiping to see the notification tray is the best thing in the world.

Regarding software, I know this is more of an Android Q thing, but please improve gesture navigation. It's okay as it is, but OnePlus and Apple do it so much better, please just copy theirs, just rip it. Also, I remember when the 2 was announced there were so many cool software features such as Now Playing. Can we get more stuff like that with Pixel 4? They were so cool!

Oh, and fix some of the bugs with fast charging too.

I know it sounds like I'm complaining a lot and comparing it to other phones. I really love the Pixel brand, I'll be getting a Pixel 4 XL regardless, so it's not that I don't like Pixels. It's just that when we spend so much money on a flagship phone, I think I'm entitled to expect a certain level of quality from the phone. If you're offering something worse than the competition at a lower price, then the Pixel brand will not survive. They need to stop treating us as beta-testers, and more like actual customers. I feel the whole Pixel team has some very amateur traits, it would be great to see Google pull it's socks up in 2019 and produce a phone that decimates the competition. They have the talent, the money and the resources. The question is whether they want to treat Pixel owners with the same level of respect other OEMs do. We'll see I guess!

Would love to hear any other suggestions for Pixel 4, any changes over Pixel 3, and any points you'd disagree with me on. Thanks for reading, I know it's a long one!

TL;DR: Pixel 4 needs to take hardware more seriously, optimise better, look better, that's about it.

**I genuinely believe that this phone has the potential to be bloody** ***fantastic***\*\*, but not unless certain issues are first\*\* ***acknowledged, then*** ***fixed.***

**A \~$1000 flagship phone should not have so many QC and software issues. I think we can all agree on that.**

But i still can't believe that some of the hardware + software issues haven't been acknowledged or been promised a fix by google, how hard is it to publish a blog post to acknowledge the issues and outline a plan to help fix them.

If i've missed anything, comment or PM and i'll add it.

1. \[Hardware\] - Speaker issues some users have experienced, including imbalances, Speaker distortion at low volumes, and \[excessive\] Vibration on the back of the phone when using the speakers.
2. \[Hardware\] - Screen quality issues and pink tint & Screen burn in problems.
3. \[Hardware?\] - Black crush (i've only seen one thread on this so far think mind you)
4. \[Hardware + Software?\] - Microphone quality
5. \[Software\] - Artificial notch being displayed sometimes when put into landscape mode
6. \[Software\] - Photos not being saved by the camera.
7. \[Software/Hardware\] - Pixel stand is the ONLY charger capable of 10W due to an *apparently* proprietary 'secure handshake'.
8. \[Software\] Ram management problems

This isn't a threat, it's a plea for them to be more open with their customers.

People prefer Android because it avoids the walled garden and secrecy that inherently comes with Apple products

This isn't a **fuck you, fix it or we won't buy the phones,** we can't be so naive to believe a strategy like that would work - 97% of the people who will buy this phone will probably never visit this subreddit or experience some of the issues we've been seeing. But i do think that an open plea, backed by tech media outlets would put some pressure on them to respond favourably.

**Google - think of it like this, if you turn around the opinion of this community, you'll only be making any future product launches more successful, it's a formative experience that every company moving into the hardware space has to go through, but you could handle it so much better, with actual thought for your customers.**

In the end, if they say ""The speakers are working as intended"", or ""we will never allow 10W charging on 3rd party wireless chargers"", then this at least allows people to make an informed decision about wether they'd like to buy the phone.

What I think we would all *like* to happen:

* A blog post or press release from MadeByGoogle acknowledging the list of issues we've all talked about, along with guidance of what to look out for, and what to do if you experience an issue.
* A blog post or official google store page on what would constitute a return-able issue or how to report that your new device has quality control issues when it arrives.
* An acknowledgement of software issues, along with an approximate timeline for a software update that will hopefully remedy the problems, along with testing these updates in beta form with nominated testers before general release -  **people are tired of paying to be the beta testers for Google products**.

A little honestly and humility goes a long way, Google.

If you have contacts in the Media, YouTube Channels, tech blogs etc, spread this thread around, please keep the comments civil and sensible, and let's try not to be the pitchfork-wielding mob, but a community dedicated to getting some transparency.

google,464,2019-01-26 12:43:21,lookitzpancakes,Google constantly tweaking our phones under the hood is what I love and hate about owning a Pixel.,"Why do I love it? Because Google will often take action on bugs, sort out aesthetic inconsistencies, push changes to UI elements, all seemingly during the course of my day to day use. I’ll wake up one day and some feature will have been introduced or a menu looks better or a native app’s been streamlined to look more in line with Pie. It’s really nice to have an OS this flexible.

But that’s also what I hate about it. On the other side of the same coin, Google will often revert changes that were helpful or break things that weren’t broken...and these things happen without warning. For example, Gboard made a change a couple months ago that matched the color of the navbar to the color of the keyboard theme. It was a subtle but INCREDIBLY attractive change for light themes that made the keyboard feel (finally) as though it was an extension of the navbar and not a third party add-on. With the January security update, that feature was inexplicably removed. Just, gone. Navbar is pitch black and the keyboard is white. What happened? Why? You don’t get to know, too bad, it’s just the way it is, and you have to hope they address it in a future update. So far they haven’t.

I switch between iPhone (XS Max) and Android (3 XL) often, and I have to say that these kinds of inconsistencies have led me to stay on iPhone more these days. While having an OS that self-improves week by week can be exciting, I feel like sometimes Google is just flipping switches on random shit with no regard for uniformity or user experience. That’s frustrating when the whole philosophy of Pixel UI is supposed to be exactly that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/ak0jrl/google_constantly_tweaking_our_phones_under_the/

google,455,2019-02-02 15:54:01,evilFry,My wife keeps breaking her Pixel 3,"We both got new Pixel 3s just before Christmas. We went on a week long vacation, took tons of snaps, everything was great.

Then this past Sunday while on a walk she drops it, and the screen breaks. With the cost of repair and the phone being on sale it wasn't going to cost too much more to simply buy a new phone and sell the old one. Lose a bit but at least get a new phone. So we did. Lined up a buyer, received payment and was all set to sell.

Then she dropped it again. Extra damage. Buyer understandably backs out. I find a new buyer who takes it a $100 less and we buy the new phone on sale.

New phone arrived just three days ago and it's been dropped again, and screen broken again.

That's 3 drops in 6 days. You couldn't make this stuff up. I have to laugh to stop myself from crying.

Doubt this belongs here but had to get it out.

My theory is that Google set an aggressive goal for itself to make the Pixel 3 phones available in a lot more countries and in much larger numbers than previous generations. The problem is that means pushing a lot more production upfront. And when you're pumping out that much product across so many more  markets, it takes a lot more effort to keep it under wraps. Something Google was not at all prepared for. But on the bright side, once the phone is released, it'll be easier to buy for everyone...

google,453,2019-01-15 07:48:51,rollk1,iPhone X to Pixel 3 XL : 2 weeks later,"I recently switched to a Pixel 3 XL from an iPhone X and wanted to give a quick review in case someone else is in the same boat.

While my iPhone X was a solid and reliable device, after 7 years of little change I grew bored of iOS, especially compared to all the cool stuff Google is doing with the assistant and AI. Luckily I was in between carriers and needed to return my iPhone X to T-Mobile, leaving me the option to either renew and get another iPhone with the same familiar iOS, or try something new. I only wanted to go the Pixel route because it's theoretically the most bullet-proof option, so I switched to Google Fi and got a Pixel 3 XL (along with a Pixel Stand).

2 weeks later and I'm pleased to admit the experience has been great and rarely do I miss iOS. That said, I went into this very open minded and prepared for trade offs in advance, ultimately making the switch from iOS to Android easier. Some of the things I did before switching to Android were:

* USE THE TRANSFER CABLE that's provided in the box during setup. If you do anything, do this.
* Replace all Apple apps with their equivalent Google apps. You can use 3rd party but I wanted the most seamless experience so went all Google (KeyChain passwords are a pain to transfer so I used this as an opportunity to update all my old passwords, which I needed to do anyway. Also if you have a lot of notes you'll need to individually copy/paste them to Keep, which is a lot easier to do on the desktop browser)
* Make sure your Apple data is backed up
* Disable and unsubscribe from iMessage (unless you don't care about SMS texting)
* Cancel any reoccurring Apple subscriptions

Once I was fully switched over there was a slight adjustment period but after a day I was hooked. A few of my favorite features thusfar:

* The assistant is genuinely in a league of its own. I find myself willingly using it way more often than I did Siri simply because I known I'll get the results faster than searching myself. I also love the squeeze feature because I don't need to sound like a crazy person in public yelling ""hey google""
* The way Android adapts to your habits is brilliant. Keep dismissing an annoying notification? It'll ask if you want to stop receiving it - not the app as a whole, but that certain message relating to the app, so you'll still see what you want to. Dim your screen a lot? It'll figure out the optimal brightness for every situation. Open Waze every day at 6am? It'll figure it out and have the app waiting for you to open. It's small things like this that makes Android disappear into the background.
* Now Playing and the always on display are awesome. I can just glance at my phone and know the time, battery, messages and song playing.
* I actually prefer Messages to iMessage. Group chats are the same, pics are high res, emojis are identical and you can search for them in the keyboard along with gifs, and you can text from ANY chrome browser so i no longer need my Apple account linked to my work computer.
* Having Google Now access by swiping left on the home screen shows relevant news articles from all over the web and it gets better the more you use it. I've discovered some great stuff from it.
* Digital Wellbeing is so much more useful and easier to understand than iOS' version.
* Having Google Maps be the default for everything is amazing
* Google Photos is creepy but also magic. I tagged 1 person and it automatically found a hundred more. I find myself searching for old photos based on memories, like ""Ben and I in New York together"" and it'll pull up that exact photo. It even works for pets, which makes for a big time waster.
* The camera is amazing, we all know it.
* Call Screening is awesome and is a unique bridge between texting and voicemail. I don't use it all the time, but when I do it makes perfect sense. For example, if I'm in a meeting and need to take a call but can't necessarily get up and walk out, I can find out what's important in real time and say I'll call them back in 5min.

I'm sure I'm missing more, but you get the point, I'm a fan. That's not to say it's perfect nor that I don't miss certain aspects of iOS. Some things I wish were better:

* I took for granted how smooth iOS and the iPhone X's gestures were. I miss swiping from the edges to get around and I'm still not completely use to it.
* I also took for granted how often I use 3D touch, especially when typing to move the cursor around and select text. I find myself struggling to select/copy/paste text and editing anything is a chore.
* If you have a Mac computer then using Airdrop and continuity to bounce between Safari tabs and copy/paste text across devices instantly is sorely missed. Though Chrome does sync tabs and I can easily text myself something, it simply isn't as good. That said Google Photos and Drive are instantly synced to the cloud, which is must faster than iCloud that sometimes wouldn't sync photos until the next hour.
* I can't pinpoint it, but apps don't feel as polished. For example, Instagram isn't as fluid and is difficult to scroll through, and some times even freezes.
* The fingerprint sensor is fine but it has more false reads than I'd like and I wish it offered face unlock as a low-security option (at least for the Pixel Stand!)
* Speaking of the Pixel Stand, it rarely works for me and I've read I'm not the only one. It sometimes doens't rapid charge, the photo album has never worked nor has the daily summary tab.
* I don't hate Chrome, but the UI is a little confusing. I wish it had shortcuts to open a tab, favorites and history. It all takes 2-3 more steps than Safari.
* ""Layering"" of the same app is VERY confusing at first. For example, when using the camera and switching to night sight it feels like you're switching to a separate app; the other controls disappear and an X appears that takes you back to the main camera. Why not just add it to the bottom scroll next to camera and video mode? Or even more frustratingly, when you use the home screen search widget it opens results in what looks like Chrome but is actually Google Now. So if you later return to Chrome your past searches and tabs aren't in it, so you need to return to the Google Now app to keep searching, which natively opens with a blank page deleting whatever it is you were looking at. Yes, I know there's a setting that opens Google Now searches in Chrome, but it's still counter-intuitive and requires more thinking than it should.
*When uploading images from another app you're only able to see the main camera roll, albums are confined to Google Photos which makes no sense.

There's a few more small quirks that make me go ""huh?"", but I have faith that Android Q will iron out a lot, sort of like how iOS 12 fixed all of iOS11 issues. I also believe the Pixel 4 will be even better and I hope the deign is more radical.

**TLDR;** If you're on the fence, know that Android is more than capable and delivers an exciting new experience that doesn't leave you missing much from iOS. But also be aware that there are tradeoffs and it won't be as tightly integrated and screwed together as an Apple product, at least not for a little longer. That said, if you're in the market for a new phone then now is a better time than ever to switch. Apple isn't releasing anything exiting for a while, whereas Google is doing a lot of thoughtful stuff with AI that actually makes your life easier, and I don't think any of these things are on Apple's radar. For the time being I'm more optimistic in Google's future and am willing to invest more of my time/money to see what they're capable of.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/ag661r/iphone_x_to_pixel_3_xl_2_weeks_later/

Insurance had expired so I paid for a new 3 xl at full price. It didn't really make sense to buy last year's model again. Received the new phone a few days later. Two days after that Google dropped the price $200 in the store. That really added to the sting of my phone theft. I wrote an email to the Google Store describing my situation and asked if they could do anything about the price drop. Received an email the next day telling me that they were going to credit $200 back to my card. Very happy with the 3 xl and their handling of the transaction.

Was at a party last night and ended up seeing someone with a pixel 3 xl, and I’d never seen anyone with a pixel phone at all prior to this.   Ended up talking to the guy about it for awhile and he was showing it off.  To be honest, it’s much better than I anticipated.  As someone who owns an iPhone X, I was pretty sold on the phone based off of all the features I saw.  It seemed just as snappy and smooth as iOS if not moreso, and the camera was absolutely insane, especially in low light. If I wasn’t in a leasing program with the iPhone I’d upgrade now, especially with the Black Friday deals.

Although the quality control issues appear to be a big issue, at least according to this subreddit, seeing real life use with the phone and getting to mess around with it makes me want one pretty badly.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/a0elg1/finally_met_someone_with_a_pixel_in_the_wild/

google,417,2019-01-23 04:10:39,zurtex,Reminder: When returning a device always remember to photograph every step,"The short story is the returns label in my returns box was not the same as the returns label that was emailed to me and Google never marked it as returned. Google support eventually got so tired of talking to me that they checked the photos I had and they found the returned phone.

The long story is late October my Pixel 2XL slipped out of my pocket as I sat down and the screen cracked (I hate curved glass screens). I went through the insurance process and returned the phone, after a few weeks I got an email telling me it hadn't been returned. This wasn't the first time I returned a Pixel 2XL phone so I wasn't bothered, and like the first time Assurant told me the system just does that and as long as the tracking number shows as returned don't worry about it. 

About one month later I got a [mailed a letter](https://imgur.com/a/2iSXDMq) telling me I had not returned the phone and demanding I pay $2,000. This time I checked in with Google Support to ask them what was going on. Google Support proceeds to tell me it should of been sent back on a different shipping label:

 > Support: I just checked the tracking of this order and it shows with FedEx that this is still Pending. This was the tracking that I used: XXXXXXXXXXXX. Do you happen to have a different one?

 > Me: That's not the tracking number that was in the return sticker I got I got a UPS Ground return label, not a FedEx return label, I dropped it off with UPS

I expected at this point to give Google the correct tracking number, for them to find it and it all be resolved. This is not what happened. After I gave them the returns label I was told this was not correct and Google does not have the phone and there is nothing they can do. I did not let go of the issue and it was a lot of back and forth:

 > Support:  You may need to check with Assurant why they give you a different return method apart from what Google has on it's system.

 > Me: I know Google has the phone, I have the recipient of it's return, photos of the return box and the return label Google gave me

 > Support: I'm sorry, I couldn't help you with something that we don't have.

I've worked in technical support for many years so I kept asking support to escalate the issue:

 > Support: There's nothing to escalate. We can stay on this chat, but the same information that you have will not take us anywhere. If Assurant gave you that return label and tracking, please seek their assistance as they may ave given you a different one.

> Me: There is something to escalate, you have the phone as marked as not returned, I have proof that it is returned

I pointed out Google handles sending and receiving the hardware so what this support representative said, the response was:

 > Me: Google sends and receives the physical hardware, not Assurant, so it is therefore on Google's side

 > Support: That's partially correct. But we don't use UPS, especially for returns. That's only for Canada, not in USA.

What does that mean? I don't know but support clearly got tired of me not letting this issue go after about an hour:

 > Support: I'm sending you an e-mail now so you can forward me anything that you have.

After this I went back and checked all the communication, I found the shipping label they emailed me was the Fedex label mentioned but the shipping label in the returns box was a UPS one. I sent a [photo of the box](https://imgur.com/a/eJIefsE) with the shipping label that I received from Google. After 1 day I received this email:

 > Apologies if I was a bit skeptic yesterday as it was really odd that there was a different tracking on your end vs what we have on my side. However, I have good news for you. I have received a feedback from the team and was able to confirm that your RMA is now marked as received. This should also reflect on Assurant's system.

I'm appreciative of the apology, but having worked in support myself I'm frustrated that as the customer I had to both provide overwhelming evidence and also not stop asking for them to escalate for nearly an hour. I contacted Assurant afterwards and they confirmed they can't check anything and aren't involved in the returns process in anyway at all.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/aivqxj/reminder_when_returning_a_device_always_remember/

* Battery life lasted only 1/4 of the day
* Random battery shutdowns — once at 40%
* Once the phone shutoff, not powered down, but shutoff with 20% battery and I couldn't get it to respond until I plugged in a charger and held the power button for 30 secs.

Weird stuff like that which made me think it was time.

&#x200B;

My first impressions after 24 hours is that I love the phone.  It's nearly the same size as my XL, undistinguishable to me.  Additionally, the OS is much snappier and responsive than the XL.  Better hardware, better battery, what's not to like?  With my cover and the tempered glass, the phone really feels no different in my hand...and it feels like a high end phone...but lighter than my XL.

I am on Fi, so I used the Google trade in program for my XL 128Gb and they offer from them was only $105...I wished it was more because that's like only 10 percent of the phone...but I figure whatever.  Additionally, I'm glad I stepped down to the 3a XL verus going to the 3XL for this reason, price point.  I spent $400+ for the 3a XL, not $1k.

google,402,2018-06-12 18:09:39,Sammibulin,Opinion: Google needs to lengthen software support,"So with the Pixel line Google is seen as directly taking on Apple with their own personal hardware. While the pixel can be seen as on par or better in terms or hardware or software, Apple is far better with software support. Case in point, the iPhone 5s from 2013 will be getting the latest iOS. Apple constantly manages 5+ years of support. If Google wants to seriously compete need to extend the support of the pixel lines. 2 years of platform and 3 years of security patches is not enough. I understand Qualcomm plays a role in the updates but if Google wants to be in that upper echelon they have the money and means to force Qualcomm. Either that is the option or go the Apple route and build your own SOC's. 

Tl:dr Google doesn't support their phones long enough and needs to be better to compete with Apple.

Pixel 3 (regular) is an expensive flagship too!! And if issues like Speaker distortion as Austin Evans highlighted exists, it needs to be spoken about in depth. With almost everyone focusing on the 3XL for dat notch, we're loosing coverage for what could be one of the best one handed phones in the world. As a consumer who doesn't have access to a demo device before purchase, the decision to purchase depends on reading tens of reviews by Ars technica, Android Police, the verge etc. And when such companies and experts in display quality like Displaymate don't talk about the regular Pixel 3 display, it does create an uncertainty which can simply be solved by addressing the different aspects such as the Screen and Speakers of the Pixel 3 and 3XL in depth. Show some love for the 3!

EDIT - Special Thanks to the anonymous redditor for the reddit silver, it is the first i've ever received :)

The interesting part about these live wallpapers is that some react  based on touch, tilts and turns. but some of them are special. Some move if the phone senses that there is music playing around, one burst when the person unlocks the phone or notifications come up and some change their theme/ colours based on time of the day like day/afternoon/night. 

Though, if you have any questions about the phone, feel free to put them here and i'll ask  my source. And also, the leaks are not over yet as I have found some really interesting official stuff (Hint: Demo videos!).

google,388,2018-06-25 19:40:16,trilogee,PSA: You can pin android messages to your Windows 10 Taskbar,"looks like this https://prnt.sc/jz8t76 (far right)

I've only tested this on chrome but should be possible with any browser. 

Go to messages.android.com > sign in with qr code and make sure 'remember this computer' is selected. Once it loads, in Chrome go to settings drop down (top right corner) > more tools > create a shortcut. 

That will create a desktop shortcut in windows 10 start menu that you can pin to taskbar by right clicking. This actually becomes a desktop application and not just a chrome bookmark. 

**Edit: 10/16/2018** /u/gbrown2036 spotted that this method no longer works in Chrome v70. This implementation now opens messages in a new tab within chrome. So far confirmed only on 64 bit version. See below for his workaround which was effective for me:

..either a bug or it's being deprecated.

Try this:
Go to chrome:\\apps and locate your ""Messages for web"" icon then right-click and first choose ""Open as new window"" then right-click again and choose ""Create shortcuts..."" then you can pin that again.

For me it always seems to open as maximized regardless of shortcut setting but at least it works.

I have been lurking the subreddit for at least a month now, and I finally pulled the trigger, and man I love everything about it.

Also being able to close all the apps at ones is very convenient. The camera is amazing like I expected but have yet to use the famous nightsight feature. I love how easy it is to view notifications from sliding my finger down from the finger print scanner.  I like how I can edit almost anything, make a dark low profile keyboard. Also the display looks so crisp. The double click on the power button is amazing because it is so easy to access the camera, this is preferred over the swiping up from the bottom.

google,379,2019-02-28 23:40:58,dtullz,The Galaxy S10/S10+ reminds me why I love my Pixel,"I've had my Pixel 2XL for about 1.5 years and I've experienced my fair share of issues. I've never had to RMA a phone, but I have had issues like a buzzing speaker, some grainy-ness to the screen, and some random software issues. I've been looking at an upgrade and the Pixel 3/XL just hasn't done it for me but I wanted to check out the S10 because that design is 🤤. 

However, after picking up an S10 I was struck by how much I didn't like it, specifically because of the software. Everything looked cartonish and bloated. Bixby seems to clutter things a bit and the T-mobile variant I played with had a ton of extra games that seemed like they were pre-installed. All the reviews I've seen about One UI have been positive, but I have to disagree.

I love the software on my Pixel. I use the squeeze for Google assistant almost daily, and everything from the menus to navigation just feels light and snappy. The haptic feedback I get from pulling the pill up to access is so smooth and satisfying, and I actually really enjoy the new app switcher on Android Pie quite a bit. The SD 835 is now 2 generations old and it still absolutely flies through any task I throw at it. In comparison the S10 just felt slower and the menus looked really plain/ugly in my opinion. 

This could absolutely be confirmation bias speaking, but I feel like the pixel is the right choice for me. It's far far far from a perfect phone and they absolutely need to step up the hardware, but there is something about the way it performs and feels thats just better than any other phone ive tried and that's why I love it.

Here's hoping the Pixel 4 does something special with the hardware to push me towards an upgrade.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/avxqz9/the_galaxy_s10s10_reminds_me_why_i_love_my_pixel/

I can confidentially say that P3xl is 95% or more in size with P2xl, to a level that we can say ITS a P2xl with a screen stretched up around the notch..
You can see in the attached photos, putting the P3xl screen protector over the P2xl screen, the notch is as deep as the top bezel of P2xl, and the bottom bezel is almost identical in each..
Size is also identical, both phones have the same overall size (in screen protector photo over the back of P2xl) 
Side bezels are more slimmer for my eyes.. 
Photos attached should clear everything out..

I was travelling to my hometown. I connected my phone to my car infotainment system, started a playlist on Apple Music.

&#x200B;

There was a moment which I wanted to take a picture of. I pulled over my car and took my phone to click a picture. Boom, Apple Music stopped abruptly. I started Apple Music again and clicked another picture to see if I could reproduce the issue. It happened again.I doubt it's an issue because of ""less"" RAM. Upon checking the Memory (under Developer Options). I could see more than 30% memory was available to be utilized. Apple Music used an average of 67Mb with the maximum utilization of 170Mb. Camera used an average 1.5Mb with the maximum utilization of 180Mb.

&#x200B;

I believe (and hope) the RAM management and aggressive killing of apps running in the background can be fixed. Android should prioritize active \`MediaSession\` under \`MediaBrowserService\` and should not kill the service. That's a bad implementation. I hope next update fixes it.

Need help and advice,"So last December I purchased a Pixel3 XL in the US as a tourist. This has turned out to be a complete nightmare. The device broke and it is literally impossible to have it serviced from Google.

Since it's a ""US"" device Google only allows it to be repaired in the US. And they are completely anal about it.

Ive tried to submit it to a Google verified repair center in Singapore but they are not allowed by Google to repair it.

The repair shop says its the same parts / parts in stock / easy repair.

Its purely a policy issue by Google which is completely insane. It did not ever occur to me when I bought it as any other brand can be repaired globally with a global warranty... But not Google.

After days on Google support they are in a loop where they say there are only two options for me: Travel to the US again or send it to relatives in the US to have it repaired. As I have no relatives in the US and the ticket cost more than the phone its not realistic options. I feel Google is bricking my phone just for laughs. The repair shop has reasurred me that the parts are the same and the repair can be done in an hour.

Im reaching out to the community in hope that anyone has a solution or that someone in Google with a shred of down to earth problem solving ability can help me!

TLDR: - Purchased Pixel as tourist in US - Google refuse to repair it any other place than in US - Parts are the same and I'm at Googles repair center in Singapore. - Solution from google: travel to US to have it serviced.

Update 4/24:
After having 'bombarded' Google with my frustration through all channels, they caved! Phone will be repaired by their verified repair shop in Singapore! I had given up and started looking for a third party repair shop when they messaged me.

Observation: It is really, _really_, _REALLY_ difficult to get hold of google support. If you have the actual phone working in front of you its easy as the chat in the settings panel is always available. If the phone is dead and you need to chat to the same support people you have to go though a colonoscopy to reach them. At the official google pixel support pages there is _no_ way to reach either phone or chat support. Accidentally im admin for a gsuite account, I used the chat support for gsuite to get hold of ""backdoor"" links to pixel chat/phone support through a browser. Also: Since the phone was a 'US' model i had to try both Asian and US support, but google filters support on IP's. So 'backdoor' links + VPN (tunnelbear) was required to reach the right people. All in all i ended up submitting the case 3-4 times at different departments having to escalate the damn thing with every one of them before it apparently reached an individual with the authority and a good sense of right and wrong before it resolved.

Absolutely everything about this phone is amazing. The build quality, the feel, the camera (duh), the software, the wide angle lens, the speakers, the screen. Man, it's nice to use a phone even months after its release & still have it feel like you just got it, you're still excited to use it. I just love this phone. 

I was a lifetime iPhone user, first iPhone was the iPhone 4. 

Had my first taste of Pixel, I'm never looking back. Android, Google Assistant, Pixel, it's just all too good. 

Sorry I know most of y'all probably don't care, just thought this sub needed some positivity. Seems like there's a lot of negative that sticks out a lot more than the positive. Never had any issues with my Pixel, either.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/ae4q0d/i_love_my_pixel/

Literally just before typing this post, I got a phone call. I was scrolling through my Instagram at the time. I hit screen call, like I usually do with numbers I don't recognize, and lo and behold, it hung up immediately. No issues there, call screening worked exactly as intended. 

It was the closing of my previous app and opening of the phone app, only for it to close again and reopen my previous app that I noticed. Then I thought, it'd be a lot nicer if call screening functioned similar to how texts are managed in the drop down menu. 

Phone rings, drop menu, tap [SCREEN CALL], software does it's thing in the drop menu overtop my current app. 

Anyway, hope this gets to the right eyes in case there's a lot of support. 

Cheers!",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/bawxod/suggestion_keep_call_screen_in_the_drop_down/

I should mention I don't expect the repair to last. The phone was working long enough for me to bring it in to get the board replaced by ubreakifix under the defect. This shouldn't be relied on as a permanent fix, as it is just breathing a bit of life into something that is surely going to die again. It's not a true repair as much as a temp fix. A last ditch effort to get something out of a dead device with no warranty. 


__________________

About a month after I received my Pixel 2 XL the og just shut off completely and would never turn back on. It's been sitting in a drawer since. So I was bored today and decided to try to revive it. A bit of research has shown me I am not the only one and this is effecting quite a few og pixels manufactured prior to 2017 along with the motherboard issue for the mic and what not.

10 minutes at 390 F. We will see if it does anything to take care of potential solder cracks or cold solder joints.

I should add I brought the phone into ubreakifix previously to confirm the dead board. They tried a new display, and battery first. But it was obvious from the get go it was the motherboard.

I just got some new Philips Hue lamps for my bedroom, and I decided to take a picture of them in all their glory. The first pic I took was with HDR+ On, and the picture came out beautifully, showing off the pinkish-orange color I had set on the lamps and the glow they emitted around the room.

&#x200B;

Next, I took a picture with Night Sight mode. I had forgotten that it has a white balance adjustment feature on the Pixel 3 (which I just got earlier in the day). Initially, expected the photo to pick up some more detail in the darker parts of the photo, but you'll see that it COMPLETELY changed the white balance of the room. Even though the lights were still set to the same pinkish-orange color, Night Sight made them look like standard-colored lights and adjusted the room's color profile accordingly. Cool, right?

&#x200B;

Here's the cooler part: this white balance feature also works in HDR+ Enhanced now. I switched that on to take another photo and found that it did the same white balancing as Night Sight's!

&#x200B;

Was hyped the moment I ordered it but that died when Google said my shipping was delayed :( , but to my surprise it arrived 2 days after I placed the order still, so that was a nice turnout! (Better be disappointed and then surprised I guess eh? haha)

Have been using ios for the past 2 years, but I've been pretty bored as of late and wanted a switch after the battery on my iphone started to show (iPhone 7+, bought the plus version alone just for battery lol). I noticed very tiny stutters like when updating a lot of things and then scrolling, or swiping up just when I first restarted the phone the icons took a second to render fully. Still need to get use to android gestures but so far it's a breath of fresh air and I'm loving it :)

Then I paused to take a piss and I passed by my 14-month old son's room. He had been asleep for about as long as I had been on the phone and he looked really cute, so I felt compelled to take a photo with NightSight and then I thought, ""That's fucking amazing.""

And finally I had to walk the dog, so I put the phone in my jeans pocket and get this... IT FIT!

Seriously though. I have NEVER owned a smartphone that has remained this factory fresh after over a year. NEVER. The pixel 2 (regular) is the Mercedes W124, the BMW E30, the Clint Eastwood of this shit. It's still. that. good.

&#x200B;

Many of the carriers advertise their esim solution is just for the iPhone, but you can still use these carriers even if you don't have an iPhone!

&#x200B;

I am recently going to travel to Asia and as you all know international roaming is quite expensive (especially for Canadian...). My current carrier charges 12 CAD a day to use my plan's own data and minutes. Technically I can just go to the destination and purchase a local sim card there. But I would need VPN to access Google services and international roaming will be able to bypass such restriction. Also in some countries you need your passport to get a sim card.

&#x200B;

I found this carrier ([https://www.three.com.hk/eSIMMall/chi/eSIMMall/index.jsp?lang=eng](https://www.three.com.hk/eSIMMall/chi/eSIMMall/index.jsp?lang=eng)) that offers esim to anyone in the world. The price is decent (at least for Canadian standard lol). I was able to pay with a Canadian credit card and set up the phone in Canada and activate the sim (Yes I might have lost a day of usage but I just wanted to see if it worked or not). I mean, about 2 CAD a day I get 500MB LTE data and then unlimited throttled data is just much better than paying 12...

&#x200B;

You will receive an email with a QR code, simply scan it with your phone under Setting/Network&Internet/Mobile network/Advance/Carrier/Add carrier

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/7krzpr7bdtk21.png

I scanned the QR code with my phone. then I have this!

I switched to the esim and turned on data roaming, then I received this text message.

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/0604q36aetk21.png

&#x200B;

You will receive a wave of text messages and some of them are in Chinese, but don't worry, both language (English+Chinese) will be sent and they all contain the same information. One of the text messages contains your mobile number and a password for you to login to the carrier's portal and refill your sim card.

google,293,2018-07-19 17:09:51,dmziggy,Introducing Reddit Request for /r/GooglePixel,"Hey Everyone!

On /r/ProjectFi, I've provided a service called Reddit Requests to users having Project Fi customer service or general service issues.  It's worked well, and to date I've been able to help hundreds of customers reach a resolution.  

Today, I'm excited to announce I'm also extending this service to Google Pixel users to help quickly resolve some of the customer service issues that have been brought up over the past several weeks.

For those of you who are new/just seeing this for the first time, let me explain what Reddit Requests are (and are not).

Reddit Requests are requests for assistance from the community when:

- Support isn't providing the level of service you're expecting
- You've found an ""high priority"" issue that deserves the teams attention (safety/security related).

They're **not**:

- A way to harass me off of Reddit about [insert anything]
- A way to provide feedback to the Google team (you should do that [here](https://davidking.xyz/google-feedback#pixel) instead)
- A way to request anything Reddit moderation related (aka Meta topics)
- A way to ask for special favors, get my personal info, make requests about products I don't support, etc.
- A way to just have me personally troubleshoot routine issues (use the community first, then come to me).
- A way to bypass your permaban or shadowban to get support assistance.

**Users who violate the above rules will be banned from the Reddit Request system.**

If you have a reddit request related to a post that you've made on the community, you can now submit a form located [here](https://dmzapps.freshdesk.com/support/tickets/new).  This will create a Freshdesk support ticket that I will follow on my end to keep track of all of the users and issues that are on my plate at one time.  I share this with the team at Google so that they can see and review the information you've provided, including Case ID's and RMA #'s so they can review your specific case.

The form now requests everything I need from you in order to have a smooth escalation process!  Some notes...

- A support ticket number can be found from your support interaction with the Google Store team
- If applicable, an RMA number if you're having issues regarding a specific RMA experience
- A thread to a public post would be to your post on Reddit, or your comment related to your issue so I can 1:1 relate the two together.

I will do my best to reply within 48 hours during weekdays.  If I don't, I will try to get to you ASAP.  **However, submitting a ticket does not guarantee a response or a resolution.**  

Starting today, I will start accepting escalations be made via this form.  This method replaces users sending me Reddit PM's to get assistance.  I'll also refer to this post for instructions going forward.

I hope the Google Pixel Reddit community sees this as a positive way to improve the quality of service for Pixel users

Thanks so much!

All the best,

Ziggy

What does this have to do with me factory resetting my phone?

Well, it was part of my plan to just try something fresh. I got a dbrand skin, to change the look a bit, and backed up my files and did a factory reset just to clean the phone up. 

This thing feels brand new! Gestures are snappy and instant, UI navigation is fluid, app changes and animations are smooth, and everything just feels so good now.

&#x200B;

I was surprised to find a Google Pixel 2 at 10pm last night, during my walk from my apartment to my car, in the middle of a freezing rain/sleet fit. I was on a very residential street on Philadelphia, so I assume this phone belongs to a neighbor. I'm currently an iPhone owner but had the OG Pixel, so I recognized the face-down device immediately. I picked it up, went to check the lock screen and it powered down. I had a USB-C on standby and charged it when I arrived at my destination. 

&#x200B;

Seems like there's no water damage, but now that it's powered off and on, I need to enter a pin to access any features including Google Assistant. There's no emergency contact information on the phone.

&#x200B;

Does anyone have a method or recommendation for me to get the phone to rightful owner? I'll plan on posting in some local community groups, but I was really hoping to be able to Google Assistant ""Call Mom"" or ""Call Home"".. Are there any other options I may be missing? 

&#x200B;

The box arrived today at my work and was signed for by the receiver. I got an email from FedEx saying my package had been delivered so my giddy self ran to the shipping area to find my box double taped and lacking in weight like the FedEx email stated. At some point during shipping my package was opened and the phone was stolen. The box only contained a project fi pamphlet and the brown packing paper. 

I called Google and they're working on an escalation case for my issue and I also called FedEx to let them know of the situation. So now I wait for a call and/or email back with more details from both of them.

EDIT: After FedEx's ""investigation"" they said Google has to file a lost package form. I called Google back to relay the info and they said my situation is still being investigated. Here's hoping something good comes out of this.

EDIT 2: Filed a police report with my local precinct and sent the information to Google. It has been three days with no final say from Google yet -_-

EDIT 3: Got an email from Advanced Technical Support last night (10/24) notifying me my case was being looked into and that I'd hear back in 24-48 hours.

google,271,2019-04-12 10:37:03,xTeCnOxShAdOwZz,Calculating how well the Pixel 3 sold,"Hello folks,

Today I'm going to do some very rough maths to try and figure out how well the Pixel 3 sold compared to the Pixel 2. As I say, it's hard to figure it out accurately, but we can get a very rough idea using some recently released statistics.

Let's set the benchmark first. In 2017, Google sold 3.9 million Pixels (1st & 2nd Gen), which isn't all that much really.

Going back to the OnePlus 6, they claimed to have sold 1 million devices in the first 22 days of being on sale. OnePlus' Twitter account provided [this graphic](https://pbs.twimg.com/media/DfpT1b9UEAAav29.jpg).

So let's say after 30 days, OnePlus probably sold around 1.2 million OnePlus 6's. fast forward to the end of 2018, a couple of months after the release of the OnePlus 6T. Since OnePlus began selling their phones on a wider variety of networks in the US, the 6T sold even better. In fact, after the first 30 days of being on sale, [OnePlus claims](https://www.androidpolice.com/2018/12/11/oneplus-6t-sales-are-up-249-over-the-oneplus-6/) that 6T sales were 249% up over the 6. Taking our previous number of 1.2 million, this means OnePlus probably sold about 4.2 million units in the first month of release, which is awesome! This figure was released mid-December of 2018. Now it's mid April, so it's fair to suggest they've probably sold around 5 million units of the 6T.

So using this information from OnePlus, we can gain a rough idea of the number of Pixel 3/3XL's sold. [A recent study](https://www.counterpointresearch.com/google-pixel-3-oneplus-6t-sales-driven-previous-samsung-owners-q4-2018/) by Counterpoint Research looked sales of the Pixel 3 and OnePlus 6T. They found that the OnePlus 6T made up 2.4% of all of T-Mobiles sales, and that the Pixel 3 made up 7.3% of Verizon's total sales. It's important to note that the Pixel 3 is only available (on contract) at Verizon, whereas the OP6T is available on multiple carriers. In fact, the 6T is available on 3x the number of carriers the Pixel 3 is available on. Coincidentally, the Pixel 3 made up 3x the percentage of popularity of the OnePlus 6T. So, at **worst**, the Pixel 3 probably sold around 4 million units, but at **best** would have sold around 12 million units. I'd be more tempted to lean towards the middle (\~6 million).

So, let's recap. In the whole of 2017, Google sold 3.9 million Pixels. In the first month of release of the Pixel 3, Google probably sold around 5-6 million units. I appreciate my numbers are very rough, but any error will be down to my mistake in intuition, the core idea remains fairly accurate. To me, this is a huge success. Google have probably already sold just as many Pixel 3's towards the end of 2018 as they did Pixels in the whole of 2017, and that's not to mention people who also bought the 2/2XL in that same time frame. This aligns with the fact that Google's advertising has been more aggressive with the Pixel 3 than in the past, and that the Pixel brand has matured more. Given that the Pixel 3 wasn't exactly the best phone, I feel the Pixel 4, given it's supposedly going to be a bigger jump than previous years and the fact the Pixel brand is on an upward trend, will be rather successful. Of course, there's a lot of competition this year so it'll be interesting to see how well the Pixel fairs.

Again, as a disclaimer, I'm aware these numbers are very rough and wouldn't stand up to scientific inspection, but I think there's still value in finding rough estimates.

I'm super excited to finally let you all know that I'll be attending the Made by Google Event IRL on Tuesday, October 9th.  Google was kind enough to invite me to spend the day at the event and helped cover my travel expenses\*.  I'm looking forward to experiencing the launch and sharing whatever I can find about the new devices while I'm there!

I'm starting this thread early so that you can start asking questions about things you want to know about the newly released Made by Google products.  Here's how you should format your comment below:

Device:  Device Name, such as Pixel 3/XL, Pixelbook, etc.  
Question:  Some question?  


Please only put one question per comment to make it easier to vote.

Things I will be bringing that I can compare to:

* Nexus 6p
* OG Pixel
* Pixel 2

Things that I won't answer:

* Why Google did/didn't do something (let's be real... I wasn't there and I don't know)
* Anything that requires me to tamper or otherwise harm/damage the device (no devices will be harmed in the making of this post)

How I'll answer questions:

* I will answer the top karma questions and work my way down.  Any questions I cannot answer I will acknowledge and explain why.
* I will start with factual things.  For example, if you ask about size, I'll show you photos and sizing comparisons.  If you ask for an opinion, I'll give it, but I won't give unsolicited opinions.  I will clearly mark what is opinion though.
* I will try to answer questions during the event that are easy to answer, but likely I will be doing it on the train ride home or later in the afternoon to make sure I have plenty of time to get as many questions answered as possible.  So, apologies for the delay in advanced, but I hope it'll be worthwhile.

Fun Things:

* If anyone wants to do fun challenges, I will attempt if possible and not horribly embarrassing. :)
* I may bring an android figurine to be a test subject for sample photos... anything else?
* If any tech news peeps are out there reading this and want to collaborate (*cough* Android Police, MKBHD, 9to5, Verge, etc. *cough*), I'm down!  Send me a DM or a Reddit chat!  I'll be happy to link to your coverage in my comments to make it easy for Redditors to get the varying opinions on one question in one place.

Looking forward to the super awesome questions and the event!

google,263,2018-08-05 20:18:40,MrCSquared,UPDATE: uBreakiFix broke my Pixel 2 while replacing the screen,"This is a follow up post to [my post from yesterday](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/94oonp/ubreakifix_may_have_broken_my_phone/).

So today I received the follow up call from uBreakiFix and to my dismay.....I was right. The technician explains that the operator took a look and they discovered that the motherboard had been damaged during the screen replacement. The technician admitted the mistake and then let me know that his operator would take a look again *on Monday, but most likely they would need to send it to Google for a replacement which would take anywhere from 2 - 3 weeks.*

According to uBreakiFix's [terms and conditions](https://www.ubreakifix.com/terms-conditions) **""If Your Device is lost or damaged while it is in uBreakiFix’s possession for service, UBreakiFix will repair Your Device or replace it with an equivalent device, which at uBreakiFix’s option may be new or refurbished.""** I quoted this to the technician and said I expected a replacement within the week. He said he'd talk to his boss and see what he could do, but folks I'm pretty sure my perfectly functioning phone is now gone forever and that I won't have another one for weeks.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/94uuc4/update_ubreakifix_broke_my_pixel_2_while/

google,260,2018-11-18 12:41:18,fockface,Does anybody's assistant on their Pixel 3 work correctly after the update?,"I haven't found a giant thread on this anywhere but I've seen murmurings of people having the same problems as me and I wanted to get a sense of how widespread this problem is.

Assistant only activates about 1/10 times.    It will activate once and then won't activate for another minute or so.  The voice portion will activate but the on screen interface won't.   These are all problems I'm having that are currently rendering assistant utterly useless.

I tried factory resetting my phone and it solved the problem for me, however Google's default auto-updates quickly reverted the assistant back to broken.    Now I'm debating whether or not I want to reformat and set up my phone *again* just to get the assistant to a working state or if there is any hope for a patch on the horizon.

EDIT: Ok I'm relieved to hear that it's not just me.  There have been a number of suggestions to remedy the problem (retrain voice, reset cache, restart, etc..), but for me, nothing seems to work and if something does actually work it's temporary and most likely just coincidence.   **When I reformat my phone it works fine, once it updates, it breaks.**  If any bored soul wants to try this to verify that the patch is messing it up, be my guest.

Gave them a call 2.5 hours before closing and they told me if I brought it in 2 hours before closing they would have it ready at the end of the day. Drove right over (20 min) and dropped it off. Returned 10 minutes before closing to a perfectly fixed screen without any problems, and they had installed my extra glass screen protector I had laying around for free (perfectly, which I always tend to ruin with lint and whatnot).

Really nice phone!,"I bought a Pixel 3 XL a week before the launch of the 3a and I love it but I was still curious to see the Pixel 3a XL in person. I got to do that today at best buy. I'm very happy with the 3 XL but I have to say the Pixel 3a and 3a XL are VERY nice phones. They feel quite nice. I like that they're lighter than the pixel 3 XL and not as fragile as the all glass flagship phones. They feel how a phone should feel I think. It's a light, thin phone. It doesnt feel cheap. The screen is incredible. The camera incredible. Performance is pretty damn good.

Google is doing the right thing with these phones and frankly I think this is exactly what the pixel line needed. The high end phones are excessively overpriced and it's about time Google started focusing back on what really matters to most people, which is a truly great camera, great screen, in a nice light and thin form factor that people aren't afraid to handle like they are with these glass phones... AND is regularly updated and supported direct from google themselves (thats a big deal).

I think Google hit it out of the park with the 3a and 3a XL. I hope companies start competing at this price range again, hopefully bringing more and more performance and features at an affordable price.

It's a very nice phone. I hope Google is successful with it. I highly recommend it and even though I bought a Pixel 3 XL for the faster SOC and features, I could see myself enjoying the 3a XL quite a bit. It's a great phone with a great camera, great support and it does everything that is important to most people.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/boc9t2/got_to_play_with_a_pixel_3a_and_pixel_3a_xl_today/

google,246,2019-03-28 04:27:28,MrSerbious,My 4 month impression with the i7 Pixel Slate,"Heard the rumors of the slate prior to the announcement like everyone else. Watched the live stream and the official announcement and was convinced immediately it was meant for me. Tired of the windows life and everything that goes with it ( horrible updates, antivirus etc ) and the general preference for Android over iOS it just made sense. A 2-1 tablet/""laptop"" seemed to hit all the marks I wanted. Slick design and Linux support! I was one of the dummies who dropped $2k on the i7 variant, pen and keyboard. Along with the expenditure, i purchased the preferred google care plan.

&#x200B;

After a giant failed delivery ( thanks for nothing FedEx ) it was in my hands 12-15-2018. Powered it on and began setting it up. Immediately started to install the Linux environment and get a feel for Chrome OS. I bought my Girlfriend a cheap Chromebook last year and had a slight idea of it's UI, only slight because I never used her Chromebook for any real length of time. Screen as everyone has said, drop dead gorgeous. Speakers? Way above my expectations. Fast and snappy? Sorta. Simple things like opening up the ""file system"" felt sluggish, while opening chrome and loading up multiple tabs at once felt smooth as butter. The gestures felt sluggish annoyingly  even with the i7 chip. The animations were slow one moment, and butter smooth the next with no real sense of why or consistency.  The latest updates have helped a lot regarding animations. The slate does feel consistently smoother today all around compared to  day one. 

&#x200B;

The file system however, still doesn't make sense. It's tough to have complete control over copy/cut/paste anywhere on a windows file system while being limited to the functionality within the downloads folder on Chrome OS. File transfers between folders seem to take forever as well. Transferring files from my Pixel 2xl via USB to the slate seem to take forever. When searching file folders on my phone from the slate, previews and loading of the files are horridly slow. To the point where sometimes I need to disconnect and reconnect to get things moving. Cloud syncing is awesome however, there is no denying that. However I work remotely and rely on a cellphone hotspot. Seems wasteful to upload to the cloud, then download to the slate when I should be able to just transfer files I choose directly via USB to either device. 

&#x200B;

Linux support was very disappointing at first.  I play around with Blender ( not a pro, just enjoy learning and creating ) Use Libre Office often and have lived within Gimp forever. Editing YouTube videos on the Windows laptop was done with Light-works ( $400 software at the time ) and while they offer a Linux version, purchasing it was on the back burner until learning the limits of this machine. I haven't purchased it for the record so far. Blender was all but useless for anything beyond very, very basic renders.  Libre Office when open wasn't scaled correctly. I'm to understand they've fixed this issue but haven't been able to use Linux apps for a while ( I'll get to that in a minute ) Gimp works, sorta. If you don't mind chasing open tool windows around. Having them all open at the same time apparently is impossible. One huge benefit to the this Slate is the extended desktop option. Using Gimp I can keep open tool boxes, etc open on the slate and use a second larger screen to work in. Not ideal, but it's worked. Linux apps were also extremely inconsistent with loading. Some days lighting quick from click to open, other times literal mins to open. 

&#x200B;

Linux one day decided it wasn't going to work, and up to this very day I haven't been able to get it working again. Deleting the environment, and attempts to re-install it haven't worked. Which is a huge reason why I never purchased the Light-works Linux lic. Embarrassingly enough, I've been using Power Director ( Amazingly featured ) and have been enjoying it. Linux support was more than 50% of the reason for purchasing the Slate. the only true windows software I used was Light-works, which has been for now replaced with a more or less free app. My preference for open source is the reason for Gimp and Libre Office as well. 

&#x200B;

My hates -

File system that doesn't keep up. Slow and inconsistent. It's understood this is meant to be a ""cloud"" machine, but there's no excuse not to have a full featured file system. 

&#x200B;

Better Linux support, that doesn't break requiring hours upon hours of research and tech skills to fix. Spending $2k on a consumer device shouldn't require this kind of work, to use it. 

&#x200B;

Google keyboard is the greatest thing since, anything really. It's simply awesome. Quiet, smooth and well balanced in my opinion. Until you take it off a flat ( large flat ) surface and use it on your lap. Everyone has seen/heard that complaint. But it's still a very valid issue. I'm lucky to have a desk to use it on, but find at times using it as a laptop is more convenient vs using it as a tablet to type. I'm split on this one honestly. 

&#x200B;

Offline support/use is so-so. There is tons you can do, if you have apps that work offline. Very helpful. I believe there are more people in the ""not always near a connection"" boat than Google is willing to admit. We spend money to guys. 

&#x200B;

Pen is extremely useful, but way over priced for it's functionality. 

&#x200B;

My loves-

&#x200B;

Screen, n'uff said there.

&#x200B;

Sound, see above.

&#x200B;

Keyboard, ditto. ( really a necessity, and worth every penny )

&#x200B;

Used as a tablet it is a bit on the large side, but not un-usable. It's awesome to remove the slate from the keyboard when needed and have the ability with either touch or use the pen and continuing working as i was with the track pad. Reading books this way has been awesome. 

&#x200B;

Dual USB ports has been great and super convenient, as is the ability to connect thumb-drives to transfer data, even at the speed of molasses.

&#x200B;

Finally getting used to the Chrome OS environment, navigating is a breeze. I appreciate the dedicated buttons like back, refresh, play/pause etc. Not sure if they are way under rated but feel like I'd be lost without them now. 

&#x200B;

Like a Volvo, when this thing is centered and working correctly it's a dream. Sync with my actions on my phone to the slate and vise versa is getting better all the time and simply works. Touch screen with pen inputs creates a million ways to interact with onscreen media and is very satisfying. In a way I've never experienced. I've never had an issue with blue-tooth connections like most others. The keyboard folio, and slate it self are holding up well appearance wise. I hate how buggy and slow even the i7 version was on day one, and how it's beginning to be more polished with every update. At the same time, I love how polished it becomes with every update. 

&#x200B;

In the end, after four months it has gotten better. The first month I was on the fence and began looking for reasons not to return it. These feelings have dissipated ( 99.9% mostly lol ) and I""m very happy with my decision to first adopt the Slate. While there are a small handful of issues that drive me mental daily mentioned above, my over all experience has been a positive one. Content creation on this is hard, but not impossible and with a bit of adaptation has actually increased my creation speed. I believe it might be due to the simplification of the software I'm using now, vs what I was using on my windows machine. The Gimp issues still bugs me to no end, but still is usable and the same help as it was on my windows machine. ( or will be when I can get Linux working again -\_- ) I've had to force myself to get comfortable with Google DOC's for my word processing needs which ironically has been super helpful with the ability to directly save to my google drive, making it available wherever I log in. 

&#x200B;

I feel the slate is underrated and was dealt a nasty card from ""Respected"" tech blogs. Why tests the m3 version and then whine about performance?

&#x200B;

Why am I sharing this? I haven't really seen anyone wax poetic about theirs after ""long term"" use. I'm not advocating, nor attempting to shy anyone away from the slate. This device for me outside of it's major flaws/drawbacks has grown on me over the last 4 months. I can see my self staying within the Chrome OS environment long term. If this can help even just one person considering purchasing a Slate make a slightly better informed decision then I suppose this post has served it's purpose.

I confirmed with support this is valid for current subscribers, and you can use all the money towards one of the companies. 

The companies you can get gift cards to, AirBnB, Delta Airlines, Hotels.com, Southwest Airlines. 

The phone must be activated within 15 days of shipping. It must stay active (not paused) for 120 days. If you're interested check out Fi.Google.com 

To me this is just a crazy deal if you travel a lot like me. I'm taking it all towards southwest and I'll just use it when I use it :) ",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/a18j9a/today_only_google_fi_recently_rebranded_has_a/

Here's the package and visual differences: https://imgur.com/a/SZKaCWh

I measured the time for my phone to recognize insertion (OnePlus 6 shows a headset icon after it's inserted and recognized). The old dongle was ~3.4 seconds in (3) tests, and the new dongle is ~1.4 seconds in (3) tests. Worth noting that this delay is not heard when removing either cable; the system pauses the music almost instantly. 

The new dongle does not **pop** or **crackle** when removing the cable while audio is playing. The old one does. 

I can't comment extensively on the quality yet, as I don't have my preferred headphones on hand. Output levels seem similar, using the only IEM's I have on hand. I can test with some Audio Technica M50x on Monday. A [user on XDA is also waiting on his new dongle to arrive and will take measurements to compare against the old dongle](https://forum.xda-developers.com/pixel-2-xl/how-to/pixel-usb-c-audio-measurements-t3691535). 

In a Logcat, the **new** version is recognized as:

`UsbHostManager: Added device UsbDevice[mName=/dev/bus/usb/001/002,mVendorId=6353,mProductId=20532,mClass=239,mSubclass=2,mProtocol=1,mManufacturerName=Google Inc,mProductName=**Headphone adapter,mVersion=2.0**,mSerialNumber=88JG019BLXTK074J,mConfigurations=[`

The **old** version is:

**So if you're wanting to try to RMA for the new version, those are some things you can look for.**

google,234,2018-10-11 14:09:30,CrankHanki,Just received the new Pixel USB-C earbuds,"Hi guys,

After lurking for the original pixelbuds for a year now, i decided to pull the trigger on the new USB-C buds, since i dont care about cables hanging around.

&#x200B;

First of all the Sound:

Its kinda what you expect out of a 30 Dollar Headphone which are not in-ear. Not too bassy, but relatively even on mids and highs. All in all they're pretty good and exactly what i wanted. I had worse for more moneys. Just don't be too exited.

&#x200B;

My Pixel 2 xl instantly recognized those buds and walked me through the setup, pretty easy. You can interact with the assistant for like translation things, pretty handy.

&#x200B;

The build quality is fine. Well... I got them for like an hour, we'll have too see how long they hold up.

Since they're white i expect them to get dirty easily.

The buds are pretty lightweight, i had to check if I'm wearing them correctly a few times because they are so incredible lightweight.

The clamp to adjust the earpiece looks sturdy enough to hold up and the chord sits really tight.

&#x200B;

All in all i think they're worth a shot, if you're interested.

&#x200B;

google,235,2018-07-08 23:34:18,Darrena,"Thoughts on the lack of a headphone jack after 6 months and ~90,000 miles of travel","I travel a decent amount, not a complete road warrior like some but enough to clear Exec Platinum or Platinum Pro on American Airlines every year.   My travel is a mix of 2-3 long-haul (8+ hour international flights), 2-3 Transcon (4-6 hour coast to coast) and a ton of 2-3 hour short hops for meetings and often back the same day.

I travel light and if possible I will only carry my backpack so this means my phone is my primary source of entertainment and communications when I am not at a desk (I have stopped carrying my iPad, I don't want another device to have to charge).   

When I bought the Pixel 2 my big concern was having to charge my bluetooth headphones constantly and what would I do if I had to charge my phone and headphones at the same time.   I actually obsessed about this but after having the phone for awhile and used it in the real world I have stopped worrying about it.   In my mind I had the following disaster scenarios:

* Battery on my headphones run out while on a transcon flight and I have to listen to everyone around me or I couldn't watch something on my phone.  

* I would have to participate in a conference call somewhere and my headphones would be dead requiring me to hold the phone to my head for 90+ minutes while hiding in a deserted part of an airport so I don't disturb anyone.

* My headphones would physically break and I would be stuck holding my phone during calls or not being able to listen to music.

In reality none of that really happened.   I had a pair break right before the return leg on a transcon flight and I just grabbed a $30 pair from the Best Buy kiosk.   I now carry two earbuds just in case, one a nice noise canceling pair and other ""beater"" pair for use when I exercise at the hotel.

I personally believe that removing the headphone jack was ridiculous and unnecessary but in reality it hasn't been a problem.   I often leave my home at 5am for a flight, fly to a location, attend meetings all day and then check into my hotel at 9pm.  While I often need to plug my phone into my battery pack I have never had an issue with my headphones.   Even in my worst case scenario of leaving my house at 5am for a 6:30am flight and then returning the same day on a 9pm flight (away from a desk or reliable power source for 18+ hours) I have never had my earbuds die on me like I feared.   

TLDR: Removing the jack was stupid but if you are a road warrior pack a second Bluetooth earbud just in case but if you have a decent pair that lasts 8+ hours you likely won't have an issue.  I know there are other situations like cars with only Aux jacks but as a traveler this turned out to be less of an issue than I thought.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/8x5uve/thoughts_on_the_lack_of_a_headphone_jack_after_6/
google,240,2018-10-28 16:24:08,WheatonWill,Why I've Decided to Return My 3xl,"First off, I really like this phone, so I'm kind of upset that I am forced to return it.

&#x200B;

I've been having the speaker buzz issue for a few days now, and decided to contact support today to see what could be done.

&#x200B;

After trying a few things, including rebooting the phone, the support tech determined that the device would have to be replaced.

&#x200B;

Since I still have about 8 days left in the 14 day return period, I asked what would happen if  the replacement device had the same issues, and I wanted to return for refund at that point.

&#x200B;

They told me that I could only return for refund, in the 14 day return period of the original device.

&#x200B;

This is pretty shitty to be honest. And is why I am returning for refund, and almost certainly abandoning the Pixel line all together, and maybe even Google/Android.

&#x200B;

There have been too many posts here about speaker issues, and ram problems, that for a $1000 price tag, we should be treated a lot better than this. I feel as if Google is relying on people being 'stuck' with the device, instead of keeping it because they actually like it.

&#x200B;

I've had the same og Pixel XL since launch, and it's been the best Android device I've ever had. I skipped the 2xl because there really wasn't a reason to upgrade.

&#x200B;

I guess I'm done ranting now. What a let down.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

Edit:

&#x200B;

A lot of people keep messaging me, saying Google will fix it, it's not that big a deal. They are probably right. Google will fix the problem, and in the end, it will be a great phone. Until then, I will hold on to my $1000, and I urge others to do the same. These devices should be tested by quality control, not by end users.

google,232,2018-11-23 23:37:09,nikhilbg,Best buy pixel 3/3xl 400 off deal explained,"I know this is pretty last minute (about 3 hours and change left to order online or in store), but I just wrapped up at Best Buy and read through my signed agreement and got off the phone with verizon.

Best buy sales reps all told me different things regarding when I can cancel or when I can cancel my line of service (ranging from them saying that I had to wait 3 months to 6 months or something else). They all agreed however that I could pay off the phone within the first month if I elected to. Additionally, you can put up to 95% down of the balance of the phone in store.

Here is the important part... BEST BUY COVERS $400 OF YOUR DOWN PAYMENT OF THE RETAIL PRICE. That is how you actually get the discount. Therefore in the signed agreement, where it says that you are responsible for the remaining balance of the phone if you cancel your device, you are ONLY RESPONSIBLE FOR THIS SUBSIDIZED PRICE (not the full retail cost of the phone). My loan agreement clearly states that my balance is $499 for the pixel 3xl 64gb. Note however, that this means you PAY TAX ON THE FULL RETAIL PRICE OF THE PHONE, and this is paid AT THE TIME OF PURCHASE FROM BEST BUY, regardless of if you elect to pay 0% down.

After I activate tomorrow, I can pay off the phone in full through the app (there are some tricks to doing so), online, or in verizon store (cash only). And then I can cancel the line of service by calling verizon. My bill at the end of the month will read $0 as long as I do this within 3 days. After 3 days you will NOT be credited for the the $30 line activation fee and that will remain in your bill.

Instead, you can cancel the line of service first within the first three days before paying off the phone. You will then receive your bill at the end of the month with the remaining balance of the phone on it, and can pay it off then. No difference financially.

Lastly, instead of calling verizon and asking them to cancel (since that is the only way to cancel the line, apart from going into a verizon store), you can choose to do it a little more under the radar by PORTING YOUR NUMBER to another line. A cheap way to do so is by porting to H2O wireless after buying a  sim card at walmart or amazon and filling out their online number porting phone. Once you port the number you can just throw away your H2O sim and stick your own sim card in. This may be a better alternative if you do not want verizon to start questioning things, however, theoretically verizon should cancel your line without any issues if you just call them.

No verizon phones are carrier locked. However, to be safe it is best to activate it on verizon first before trying out different sims. Some people say that you have to activate on verizon first before using it with other sims, but to be honest this is what you should plan on doing anyways.

Verizon phones are bootloader locked however, so bear that in mind.

Again this is super last minute, but hopefully this helps out someone! I can post pictures of my loan agreement terms and conditions if you guys want to see that.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9ztbte/best_buy_pixel_33xl_400_off_deal_explained/

google,230,2018-12-13 09:20:42,Tomushhh,"Upgraded Pixel XL to Pixel 3 XL, my honest experience!","Firstly I'll say this, I absolutely hated the notch when the phone was announced and I was very disappointed in it totally. So below are my thoughts on getting the device and experience with the notch. 

Below is experience with the P1XL

When I first got the OG Pixel XL, it was honestly the best phone I have ever had (I came from the HTC M7 then the M9), and I have been very reluctant to upgrade. The phone has been through and seen some shit, sometimes quite literally. I mean, we take our phones everywhere.. I'll leave that there. Anyway, the OG PXL has had 2 call speakers die, i replaced one myself as outside of warranty and the other died after 2 months use. There is a massive dent on it above the charging port from a drunken fall, but I never cracked the screen. Always had in a case and had a screen protector so other than those, the phone is mint. It got quite laggy towards the end, whether or not that is planned obsolescence or not or just struggling to run a newer OS (Android 9) I don't know. Happens with all phones. 

Now to the P3XL 

Got the phone, nice unboxing experience. Was extremely happy with the purchase, but I still had it in my mind that I have 2 weeks to send it back under my contract if I change my mind. The notch was there, staring me in the face with it's awkward smile. But honestly? Is it really that bad as the internet makes out? 

No. Not at all. 

Most apps seem to darken out the top bar (like on nacho notch-ish). For example, Facebook Messenger does this. With the OLED screen it completely hides the notch. At night it's like it's not even there. I run dark mode on every app possible, and as above this hides the notch too. Even when an app has it coloured at the top, I can enable Nacho Notch but quite frankly.. I don't see myself using it. All the fuss the internet made about it is just sheepish behaviour. I almost fell into the same trap with that. Once you have the phone in your hand, you know it's a premium device. It's heavy, but not too much. Just FEELS nice. Way better build quality than the P1XL. Even from my above statement about what that phone has gone through, it was very very good then too. I am hoping this one will last as much too and I have no doubt.  

The camera. I want to write a massive paragraph about how good it is, but we all know it's the best so I won't bother. But I will compare to theP1XL, it's miles ahead. I had some some side by side photos which synced to my Google Photos and I compared them on the P3XL screen (just so the colours are represented on one device). Wow. So so many details that make it massively better. Way sharper, considerably better white balance. Gives me so much more confidence taking photos. Wide angle front is also great. Not much to say there.

Speakers. They're great. Obviously it has the back panel vibrating a bit, but I kinda like it? Feels like it's got some bass to it. Doesn't distort the audio, you just get a little buzz in your hand whilst watching a video on a dramatic scene. I wear headphones anyway for that sort of thing so it doesn't bother me. Having them front facing is AMAZING. Takes me back to having my HTC One M7 and M9. That was the best feature of those and I am glad to have it back. 

Battery? Compatible to the P1XL which was good enough for me so I'm not fussed.

A simple TL;DR is, ignore the sheepish behaviour about the notch. Appreciate the phone for what it is, not what you want it to be. Yes it's overpriced IMO but it's a small price to pay for my honest opinion being the hands down BEST phone on the market.

google,225,2018-12-16 21:33:25,dude2k5,I underestimated how much I would like this phone.,"Had the 6p, then Pixel XL. Was doing alright with it, but it was getting a bit slower and I kept running low on space. 

I kept seeing reviews about the Pixel 3 and my coworker got the 3 XL recently, he said he loves it. I didnt like the notch on the XL, but I did like the 3 size, it looked very similar in screen size, but better body ratio to the other 2. I got the not pink (the color is nice actually) for a good price and since I've held it for the first time, I can't believe how much I like this phone. 

The screen is fairly close in size of the other phones but the body is much smaller. Just holding it feels great. It feels much easier to hold and put away in my pocket. I had the HTC m7 and I like the one handed ability of that phone, but the screen was much smaller (and the camera was horrible). 

I really enjoy how vibrant it is, and it's a cooler hue, which I like as well. The buttons feels very solid, and they push well (the other phones were a bit tough to use if you've ever use them). I like the color difference orange for power. I like the squeeze ability (although I wish I could change what it does without root). The cameras are SO good, the processing time is so much faster as well. 

The phone keeps up with me, there is no lag, no waiting going between apps, things feel snappy. I didnt like the nav bar at first but it grew on me. Battery is great, I was taking pics/vids, playing pokemon, doing google maps, and still had hours to spare. Speakers are damn loud, I was surprised. 

It's one of the few phones I have yet to find any design flaws personally, I like everything they did. The headphone port sucks but I usually use a second phone for my music anyway while the main is doing gps. I love how it feels, how it looks, it's so smooth. I dont want a case but I worry it will damage, it really feels like a solid well built device. I dont want it to break!

Update: Google was not much help. They looked over my data settings and said everything seems fine. The guy was pretty vague in chat and seemed kinda dodgy. Verizon threw some extra data at me until the end of my cycle pretty much without question which is giving me the skeptical hippo face. I'm going to try what many have suggested and turn off ""Mobile data always on"" in developer options. It sounds promising.

google,224,2018-10-13 18:56:19,Bronkic,I'm so glad that I bought a Pixel 2 recently. The pictures I take of my 1-year-old daughter are worth any price.,"Just wanted to share how satisfied I am with my Pixel 2. Shortly before my daughter was born, I bought myself a small but expensive camera (Sony RX100 DSC M2) because I wanted the pictures I take of my daughter growing up to have a good enough quality to print them out. However, although the camera was quite small, it became obvious that most of the time when my daughter did something cute, I just didn't had the camera at hand. So after a lot of consideration, I decided to buy the Pixel 2 a few months ago. 

And it was so worth it! The pictures and videos I take are amazing, everyone comments on their good quality. Just today, I printed out a snapshot and put it in a frame as a present for my daughter's great grandmother. It's unbelievable how a spontanous snapshot, quickly taken with my mobile phone, can look so great.

It seemed more reasonable to wait a few months until the Pixel 3 comes out and the price of the 2 drops. But the videos and photos I took in those 2 months alone were more than worth the price I paid. I even have a video of my daughter's first steps! I just whipped out the Pixel and started filming in mere seconds. That wouldn't have been possible with my old and terribly slow Motorola Moto G or even the Sony camera.

TL;DR: I'm more than happy with this great phone. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9nw8xj/im_so_glad_that_i_bought_a_pixel_2_recently_the/

google,217,2018-10-29 02:24:45,ultrafawn,Pixel 3 Upgrade Report (it's a long but hopefully comprehensive one),"I just got the Pixel 3 (non XL) from Verizon today and I wanted to weigh in here, since I used this sub heavily in making my decision. I was admittedly nervous about it, but my boyfriend and I wanted to take advantage of the bogo, so our phones worked out to be about $400 each, which we couldn't beat with a stick. It seemed too good to pass up. 

**Buying Experience:**
I asked the Verizon guy right away if they'd been seeing any returns or hearing any complaints yet, and he said not at all. Another rep standing nearby said he has a pixel 3 XL, and I asked if he'd had any issues. At first he said no, but I asked him point blank about the speaker and he admitted that yes, he did have speaker issues, but he had gone through Google (odd, I thought, but whatever) and they were replacing it; and that if I actually did have any issues, Verizon would replace mine as well. There were no issues switching and transferring data from my OG Pixel, no issues adding a line, and no issues cancelling my boyfriend's previous carrier. He opted to data transfer himself later (from an iPhone), so I'm not sure how easy that was. Also, my phone bill is going to be $10 *less*. Yay!

**The Phone:**
The very first thing I checked was if apps had trouble reloading when switching between them (as shown in a video I'll see if I can find later). I ran maps, YouTube, photos, drive, camera, and maybe a couple others and switched between them at random, and none of them had any trouble switching.

I then checked the speaker and to be completely honest, I'm not sure if what I'm hearing is what all the complaints are about. At higher volumes (as in, between 90-100%), it does sound a bit tinny, and maybe a bit buzzy, but I really don't think I would have noticed it had I not been on high alert for speaker issues. I don't think they are fantastic speakers by any means, but no worse than OG Pixel (and definitely louder), and I use a Bluetooth speaker anyway 95% of the time.

I tried recording some video specifically to test recorded audio, and the audio didn't play back nearly as bad as some youtube videos portrayed. However, I still want to play it back on a non-Pixel device to see if that matters for any reason (I don't know if or why it would).

I also ran Spotify, maps, and took some pictures. Spotify continued to work fine, but maps seemed to stuggle. Specifically, it stopped navigating at some point, but kept the route, so all I had to do was touch Start again. I don't think this would happen if I wasn't doing all three things at once - so it's a good thing I don't take many photos while I'm driving. (This does point to potentially larger memory issues, though.)

Edit: my boyfriend just called, and we both immediately noticed some staticy sound under each others' voices while we were talking - almost like what an Xbox headset sounds like. This isn't noticeable on speakerphone though, and speakerphone sounds great. Also, I was typing this while we were on the phone, and he could hear the haptic feedback. Both issues *are* a bit frustrating.

Edit 3: The staticy headset sounding issue seems to have resolved itself. Except now I'm having an issue where the phone is randomly muting both ends on a call - where I can't hear the other person, and they can't hear me. It's happened three times in the last half hour, with two different people - one my boyfriend, and the other my mom (who is using an iPhone on a different carrier). I don't even think I've read about this particular issue.

Edit 4 (maybe I should just make a new post at some point): We ended up doing a lot of testing (like with notes and everything, very scientific) of the Advanced Calling setting. We decided that we sounded worse when both of us had the setting turned on - like, over-processed and almost painfully clear - but best when one of us has it on and the other off. When they're both on, it just sounds over-processed. Also, I haven't had any other issues with weird muting since then, either. Knock on wood.

**Details:**
The haptic feedback is really snappy and satisfying and is frankly the first thing I noticed. That said, it's LOUD. Not as bad as Apple's clicks, but up there. I do love the tactile feedback though, so its staying for now.

Edit 2: Turns out you can adjust the haptic feedback intensity. I set mine to 5 (so, very low), and it's just enough to get the feeling and not hear a *thunk thunk thunk* with every tap.

Auto correct is *struggling* as i type this. It does NOT want to correct lowercase i's. It randomly chooses not to correct other typos that are not even real words (such as ""firat"" and ""choosee"", both of which i had to manually correct). Not sure if this is something it will have to learn, but its google - it should come pre-learned.

The camera is, as expected, the best feature of the phone. I'm not sure I can say anything that hasn't been said.

**Conclusion/TLDR:**
TLDR: Just upgraded from Pixel OG to 3 (neither XL), decision aided by a sweet discount. Overall, i am pretty pleased with it. I did not expect perfection, but i certainly dont feel like im an unwitting beta tester or anything like that. While some of the negative feedback appears to be accurate, i feel like some of it is blown a bit out of proportion. I am thankful for ALL of the info i gathered from this sub (good and bad) so i could make an informed decision - just want to give that back in as unbiased a report as possible.

Fortunately for me, the FedEx truck was still outside. So I ran outside and saw the delivery driver getting back into the truck. I stopped her and asked her if she had a signature-required item for my apartment. She said she did, but that because she'd already marked it as not delivered she might not be able to release it now.

Which is exactly what her delivery app said.

So she called internal support and got them to reset the package so she could deliver it. She had me verify that it was my apartment by having me unlock my door for her, but then she handed me my Pixel Slate, which I happily signed for. And this story was typed on my brand new Pixel Slate.

We've had a lot of ""FedEx didn't deliver my package"" stories here, and I know people are starting to get worried. But I just wanted to share this because the majority of deliveries do go smoothly, and my particular FedEx driver went above and beyond to make sure I got my package today.

Sadly I didn't catch her name, but I'll definitely be contacting FedEx to let them know how fantastic our driver is.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/a1v59n/another_fedex_story/

I just discovered the gestures can be triggered from anywhere in the nav bar. Being able to use the app draw gesture by swiping diagonally from the bottom-right corner (as I'm right handed) makes using it awful lot easier.

Update: also just realised that the app switching left/right gesture also works from any location in the nav bar. Maybe this is all common knowledge to people, but wasn't immediately obvious to me!

So I was holding phone in my hand when other canoe bumped into us and phone slided to water. Just like that. 
Moments later I was in the water trying to find it, but it was gone. Unfortunately it was one of the deepest parts in the lake. After 30 minutes of diving and trying to find we gave up. It was simply to deep, roughly 3 to 4 meters and plenty sludge. 

Yet the phone was only two weeks in my hands.

The great part is that a professional diver, a friend was found and he came almost 7 hours later. Fast forward he found the spot since when diving earlier we ruined the surface, and then 20 minutes in he retrieved the phone. Basically the moment I got it to the hands, messages start coming.

&#x200B;

**First impressions:**

1. **Screen issues are fixed.** I have a 2XL with an average blue shift and screen grain, and both models had absolutely zero issues.
2. **Great build quality.** Both felt nicer to hold than my 2XL.
3. **Fantastic vibration motor.** Those with the 2(XL) running Pie, go tap your home button. If you think that's crisp, the 3 was even better. It felt equally crisp, though marginally weaker (though that might be a vibration duration thing) than the iPhone XS on display next to it.
4. **The notch doesn't bother me as much as I thought it would.** As a strong notch hater ever since the iPhone X was released, I have to say it's not as bad as I thought. **It looks awful in photos but honestly tolerable irl.** The depth of the notch and status bar especially, I got used to that within the first 10 seconds. I much prefer this narrow, if not slightly deeper, notch to the wider one on the iPhones.

If you guys have enough questions, I can go back down tomorrow or on the weekend to find out more. I did not play with the camera or get to blast anything out of the speakers in the store, plus it's running retail mode so I'm limited in how deep I can dig (tried to enable developer options to hide the notch but I need a password for that).

google,193,2018-11-04 23:22:54,gobackclark,Lifetime Apple user to Pixel 3 review,"Hello all! I know pixel 3 phones have been out for a few weeks now but I thought I'd add my review in hopes it might help someone. 

In short, I love the pixel 3 and would absolutely recommend. 

I've had it for one week now. I upgraded from iPhone 6S, so it obviously was a big upgrade. I'll just go through a few of my thoughts on several things.

I haven't had any problems with software or hardware. That was my main concern, like most of you probably. So I'm happy about that. My speakers work so well it's almost unbelievable how loud they can get. Screen looks great. No RAM issues, no music cutting out with picture taking. Even the audio recording problem for video isn't super apparent. Like I can tell it's there and I don't like it, but I don't hate it and won't avoid taking video because of it. One thing that does bug me is the scroll down on fingerprint scanner for notifications doesn't work all the time and that gets annoying. 

The camera is amazing. My brothers have the latest version of iPhone and my camera exceeds theirs in almost all regards. Night sight is an absolute game changer.  A lot of the reviews for night sight showed super dark situations that indeed did get brighter, but it still didn't look like a high-quality photo. But what I've found value in is shooting night sight for lower light inside shots that could also be shot with the normal camera. Night sight makes the picture so much clearer it is far and away the better shot compared to iPhone Xs. The portrait with bokeh effect is great, and I have curly hair--rarely see a problem. And I thought wide angle selfies was kinda a gimmick but I actually use it all the time. It's great. 

Switching from iOS to Android had its few bumps the first couple days but I'm already really enjoying android. Especially how it deals with notifications--I love that it's more subtle and not in your face all the time. I LOVE always on display and the little notifications under the time...makes it so I don't always have to wake my phone to see if I missed anything. I really appreciate the integration of Google software. With iOS it was always pushing you to use apple maps and Safari and I had both Google photos and the apple camera roll and it got confusing. Not here! It's all very simple and easy to use.

Battery isn't that great, actually worse than I expected. Like not terrible, but for a brand new flagship phone I think it should be better. For whatever reason the battery drains fairly quickly during idle time.  Maybe these are bugs that need to get worked out. 

Another thing to keep in mind with comparing apple to pixel is the price. I don't see that playing a factor in a lot of people's decisions, but starting at $200 cheaper than iPhone is a huge deal to me. 

Again, I'd totally recommend. Hope this helps someone with their decision.

I did this considering the fact that I am a Pixel 2 user myself and I don't see a lot of Google phones around me. I've had a great experience with the Pixel for more than 6 months and another couple of years that I used the Nexus 6P as well.

​

Despite the many great features, why do you think Google has not been able to sell as many units as the Pixel deserves? Is it the lack of retail outlets, lack of advertising and promotion, no real positioning of the phone, the look and build of the phone or something else? Would love to hear what everyone here thinks.

I also read that you can use Google Find My Device and then unlock it  there by setting a new pin, but supposedly this only worked up till last  year can anyone confirm?

The nuclear option is to reset the phone, and I confirmed it does have a  backup. But I'm really worried that option would leave me with  incomplete data. Would it have backups of all his text messages over the  last year? Would I be able to set a new pin? Is there any other method  besides this I could use if the above two no longer work?

google,188,2019-01-06 14:26:10,LurkLurkingstein,Pixel 3 - super easy to reset from the bootloader. Is this on purpose?,"Background: I work at a third party cellphone store. We handle account management for certain carriers.

One day, a distraught girl walks in with a Pixel 3. She tells me that she set a password on the phone but can’t remember it at all—she says she might have put the wrong password in by mistake. Story sounds a bit fishy so I ask her for proof that she owns the device.

Surely enough, she produces papers proving that it was activated under her name and account, and her IDs match. Okay.

I couldn’t for the life of me figure out what to do. First, I tried looking for a way to contact Google support. No luck there because I  couldn’t find a single support phone number to call. This is in Canada, BTW. I know there’s a support option in the Settings app in all Pixel phones but if you can’t get into the phone itself in the first place, it’s useless.

My next idea was to erase the phone remotely from ADM. I had the girl sign into her Google account on a computer and sure enough, the Pixel 3 was listed in ADM. But every time we tried to erase it, we ran into an error. Phone had LTE enabled and all.

My final idea was to see if I could erase it from the bootloader. I figured it wouldn’t work because of FRP (Factory Reset Protection) or the phone forcing us to enter the password before erasing it.

Weirdly enough, it didn’t. I got into the bootloader easily, I was able to factory reset the device from there and set it up as a new device.

I’m just rather confused as to why this is possible on such a premium device? Basically anyone who steals your Pixel 3 can easily reset it from the bootloader. The girl’s bootloader wasn’t unlocked either. No unlock sign on the boot up screen.

**Edit**: it appears the Google account that was on the phone is required after you reset it from the bootloader but it never asked us to sign back into her Google account. The phone acted like it was being set up for the first time??",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/ad5zah/pixel_3_super_easy_to_reset_from_the_bootloader/

If you type ""radical islamist"" in any app, using the google keyboard on Android (at least on the pixel 2), the keyboard suddenly halts all attempts to correct spelling or suggest words, and drawing on the keyboard to spell out a word does nothing. This persists for an odd amount of time. Neither of the words does this separately, only when typed together in sequence.

This is on the latest software update on, at least, the Pixel 2 XL.

Given the potentially sensitive nature of those words, this seems like it could be a privacy issue. Why else would the keyboard care about those two specific words, enough to break it's software for a few moments?

They were both on tables near each other, but the iPhone models had the following:

- Colorful wallpaper to show off the vivid display and hiding the notch
- Lots and lots of apps to try
- Interactive demos of FaceID, messages, Animoji etc.
- Lots of games to try

On the other hand, the Pixel 3 and 3 XL had:

- Boring black wallpaper with a big 3
- A boring list of new features as demo
- Exactly one page of apps with like 4 stock apps on the homescreen, and maybe 10 apps in the drawer
- No internet connection, so can't test out YouTube/Google Feed
- Nothing showing off Google Assistant/Squeeze
- Pixel Stand next to it wasn't working
- 'Natural' mode was set for the display, so it looked very bland in the bright lights of BestBuy
- Nothing to show off the awesome camera features like Super Zoom, Top Shot, Portrait mode etc.

Overall a terrible demo IMO. Even the Google Home Max was just sitting there with no way to test the sound.

Samsung phones nearby had pretty good demo units too. I left BestBuy annoyed about how Google can excite customers if their demo units are just so bland and unexciting to look at. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9o92ax/google_is_still_terrible_at_marketing_their_phones/

I currently own a Pixel 2XL. I was very happy with it and ordered a shiny brand new Pixel 3XL. When it arrived, I noticed a problem with the speakers; they were very soft and I wasn't even able to watch an episode on Netflix in bed. I double checked it with my roommates (he also bought a Pixel 3XL at the same time as me) and indeed my device was defective. 

After looking online and finding that I wasn't the only one with this issue, I called Google support to request an RMA and receive a working phone. 

This led to a long, arduous ~10 days where I was repeatedly transferred between the Google Store and Project Fi sections of the support team. Each time I was asked to provide verification of who I was, spell out my physical address of delivery/e-mail address/personal information only to be put on hold for another 30 minutes while they bumbled about with my account.

At the time of writing they have processed an RMA for my phone but have failed to provide me with shipping labels so I may send back the defective phone. They have attempted over 10 RMA requests. 10 RMA requests, 10 ~30 minute waits on hold listening to the same Zagreb orchestra support song, 10 times I've had to provide my information, 10 spelling out of my address.. and many many more being thanked for my patience.

Somewhere in the middle of the process they promised that they sent me an e-mail with an RMA processing link and the return shipping labels; they indeed did, however the e-mail was completely empty with no link or labels. Just a way to get me off the phone in hopes that I wouldn't call back I guess.

This is beyond ridiculous. I was offered a measly compensation in the form of a play store credit which I declined because I have no use for it. I requested a Project-Fi credit (which is a service I actually use) and was promised early on in the process but was then transferred to a supervisor, put on hold for another hour and then rudely told that she ""did not have the authority to issue said credit"".

While I was happy with my Pixel 2XL, this entire experience has left a very bad taste with me. I would not recommend anybody purchase this phone until they address the issues with defective speakers. 

Sorry for the rant and thank you for listening to me.

I get that you can just [read the changelog](https://developer.android.com/preview/release-notes), but actual experience is what most of us care about, plus it makes life easier to fix issues if you are currently having problems.

**Changes that have so far been discovered:**

* Android P is now officially numbered as version 9 (with API Level 28)
* Date now appears underneath the time in notification shade 
* Added padding on quick settings icons (more space, cleaner look)
* Quick settings are now symmetrically centered
* New page for previously connected Bluetooth devices (only works when Bluetooth is ON)
* Brightness slider is now logarithmic instead of linear.
* 5 June Security Patch - [Fingerprint sensor is intentionaly slow (on Stable 8.1 too)](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/8p3jxw/the_screenon_delay_is_intentional/)
* The icons in the Security settings are now green
* The 'Downloads' application was renamed to 'Files' back again
* You can 'Quick Reply' on bundled notifications
* 157 new emojis were added
* The gesture navigation has been improved and it's more stable now
* Swiping up from the back button now gets you in the overview 
* 'Clear all' buttons were added to Recents menu (access it by scrolling to the very left)
* Biometric API (Devs don't have to make their own dialog, so safer and quicker access to make payments in the same way, in all apps in future), it now also supports Iris scanning, under-display fingerprint sensors and Face authentication sensors.
* The Colours menu has got a visual change that shows a default image to help you decide which Natural, Boosted or Saturated option suits you the best
* [Location icon missing from status bar](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/8p5bh3/location_icon_missing_from_status_bar_in_dp3/)
* 'At Glance' Weather widget shows up on lockscreen and AOD (Pixel 2/XL only - the widget is coloured instead of B&W on AOD) 
* The application closing animation seems to be gone
* Stock launcher: App drawer is less transparent
* Stock Pixel launcher can now rotate again when in landscape
* Vibration is a lot stronger compared to DP2
* System wide font changes - It was 'Roboto' whereas it is now 'Product Sans' in many places
* Lock down button added to long press power on/off button
* No 'Wellbeing' features were added in DP3
* Charging shouldn't involve further issues for those that had any
* Lock screen shortcuts are removed
* Fingerprint sensor illustration image now uses Google's colours

**What is and what isn't working:**

**Applications**

* Magisk seems to work for most
* DJI GO 4 application crashes and doesn't work
* Instagram and Snapchat seem to function normally
* GBoard can often pop up on screen after unlocking device with fingerprint
* BlackBerry Works now functions properly
* Google Pay seems to work for most
* Custom Navigation Bar app doesn't seem to work
* Nova Launcher gestures aren't fully supported (can swipe up for recents, but not twice for applications)
* Substatrum both w/root and rootless does not work
* 'Quick Reply' does not work for Hangouts from notification shade  
* Wells Fargo deposit check feature does not work

**System**

* CustomUI tuner seems to be disabled on DP3 (you can get it back [via this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.zacharee1.systemuituner))
* You may have some Bluetooth issues (some people do not experience the same as on DP2 - if you strongly rely on Bluetooth, consider if it's worth the risk)
* Android Auto works, but some messages will not be sent and some applications may crash from time to time
* WiFi should turn on automatically once in range (was broken in DP2)
* Swiping up on the dock can take multiple attempts
* 'At Glance' Weather widget doesn't work for everyone on lockscreen 
* Drag and dropping applications from drawer doesn't seem to work all the time on homescreen 
* When Bluetooth is ON, it doesn't appear in the statusbar (only when connected)
* Notification sounds may not work for some

**Solutions that seem to have worked for some users:**

* [Here's how to get back SystemUI tuner without Nova launcher or ADB](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/8p50yo/simple_way_to_get_system_ui_tuner_on_android_p/)
* If you don't see 'At Glance' weather widget, make sure weather updates are turned on in Google app. If they are and it's still not working, try uninstalling updates of Google application and update it - it should work again.

Thank you all for your responses. Based on the advice I got here, I ended up buying a Caseology Legion.

If I hate it, my next step will be to try a Spiegen Rugged Armor.

And if I'm still not satisfied, I'll go for a Ringke Fusion.

Out the box it was running 8.0, which meant my Google backup from my Pixel XL on 9.0 wasn't recognised. So I proceeded to do a ""set up fresh start"" and let the phone update.

The 9.0 update came in straight away. However it then started installing the security patches, one by one. Starting with October 18, November 18 all the way up to March 19.

Because of project Treble and the phones inability to install updates unless it is ""idle"" it seemed to take the best part of an hour to download and install in the background (despite me not using it and having fibre broadband) and reboot and install before moving on to the next patch. it did this about 6 or 7 times. Then I had to factory reset it to set up again restoring my Google account backup.

Is this really how new Pixel Phones set themselves up!? My old Android devices could make do with one update that contained all the previous ones, not the need for multiple successive updates.

This seems crazy... Google really need to consolidate them into one bigger update the first time a device is set up.

It's been 4 months.

I'm losing it. I should have got an iPhone.

It all started when my Pixel 2's screen went completely black (with some fingerprint sensor vibrations occasionally going off) about 4 months ago. I tried to work with Google support to troubleshoot and recover data on my phone. They couldn't do anything. So they sent me to their dumpster humping 3rd party affiliate, UbreakIfix. I went to three different Ubreakifix stores and they basically humped my phone and said ""sorrrrrry we can't help with that, looks like a haaaardware issue hahahaha"". What? Isn't that why you're Google's physical store affiliate? Whatever. I'm resilient and try some other options online to try to recover this data and get the phone screen to display on a computer monitor. Nothing appears, so definitely a software issue.

I'm sad about the lost data, but I'll live. So I send in my phone to Google for a replacement. Now this replacement process is not a quick switcharoo, it will take 15 days. (Hate that there is no physical location to swap it out, but I suck it up.) Two weeks go by and I finally get the email that my replacement from FedEx is on its way. Stoked. So stoked. Until I find out that they only deliver M-F (no weekends) and you HAVE to be home to sign for it. What type of hogsucking cocksucker expects me to take a day off of work to sit and wait for a phone to arrive. Granted my situation is a little more unique than most, I'm on the road M-Th constantly traveling between work sites. So I have one day, one motherfucking day for them to try to get that phone to me. I let them know this oh so many times. I suggest sending it to Fedex's secure partner walgreens. But nope. They keep trying to ship it to my place when I've explained I'm not home. Wonderful. So unsurprisingly after too many attempts to my empty residence, I get notified by Fedex that my package is on it's way back to the shipper aka Google.

This song and dance has now happened 3 fucking times over 2 months. I've even stayed home days from work to be there for the package only to find out that Google put in the wrong shipping address. It's unfuckingbelievable and tonight they asked me if I'd just like a refund. A refund? On a Pixel 2 I bought over a year ago and has already been replaced twice\*? Yes please. End this misery. But that was a fucking lie too and after trying to process a refund (it didn't work, why would it?) they're going to try to ship me a new one again.

This pains me so much. I've wanted to be a Google-guy so bad. I love the camera and everything about it when it's working, but this is too much. They have effectively held my phone hostage for 2 months, thankfully I've been able to use a friend's old phone in the meantime. But what if I didn't have a friend's phone to borrow? I'm just supposed to be shit out of luck for 2 months without a phone? Or buy a replacement in the meantime?! Get fucked. At the end of the day I never want to put up with this shit again and if I had an iPhone I would have gone into a store and exchanged it same day.

Anybody else?,"I understand that this post is probably going to be quite controversial, however with what we currently know about the upcoming Pixels, I am, as a matter of fact, going to buy the XL variant.

Few months ago I decided that I am going to buy the next Pixel when it is released. I love the stock Android experience and all the pros that it entails. Plus I have very fond memories of my Nexus 6 and Nexus 5X. I find the whole experience very enjoyable.

Then various leaks started to appear. Design-wise, yes, the notch seems to be apparently larger and deeper than what we are used to seeing these days and the bottom chin could also be a bit tinier but I don't mind it. The bottom appears to be approximately the same size as the Pixel 2 XL's bezels which is absolutely fine with me. If both of these features are ment to house front facing speakers then I am going to be satisfied. Plus it is still going to be quite a step up from my current OnePlus 5. I know I might be the only one the entire planet but I quite like the look of the phone. And let's not forget that these are still leaks so why not to wait for the official announcement? Pixels have always looked better as a final products, especially when you get your hands on them. 

So the only fear that remains are the alleged 4GB of RAM. My OP5 with its 6GB is still incredibly smooth more than a year after it's release. I believe that well optimized 4GB Pixel with stock Android should be okay. Although I am still slightly worried. I am going to wait for the experience from the reviewers and if it is fine, Im buying it. Sure, I can't know how well will the 3 XL perform a year from then but who can.

So these has been my thoughts on this currently hot topic. Thank you for reading them. I'll be happy for your comments. Hopefully, I'm not really the only one looking forward to October 4th.

**TL;DR: I actually quite like the look of the Pixel 3 XL. Front facing speakers are worth it, plus the notch doesn't seem so dreadful. Still a significant step up from my OnePlus 5. Will see about the 4GB RAM, will wait for the reviews and if positive, I am buying. I'll be happy to read your thoughts.**

not Pixel Ultra but a feature in 3xl which disables the notch by making the notification bar black(with that on, it looks symmetrical and the space is used for notification icons). The prices may start at 649 for pixel3 and 749 for pixel 3xl. They should really target the iPhone XR. 50$ cheaper would be even more competetive. If you compare pixel 3xl with XR, now it doesn't look that bad right? The latter has thick bezels with ugly notch and a 720p LCD.

Some of you might remember this video by MKBHD last year regarding his Pixel 2 essentially slowing down and having performance issues.

I didn't buy my Pixel 3 XL right at launch, but I did once they dropped the price around Black Friday.  I loved the phone and its performance felt like an improvement, even coming from the Pixel 2. (So far I have owned the XL versions of all 3 Pixel phones).

But my user experience is now just awful, and I haven't experienced anything like it before. It does remind me of MKBHD's video from last year.

The phone just lags doing *anything*. Opening the recent apps, switching between apps, scrolling through pretty much anything (even the Google Now stories if you swipe left from the homescreen), etc.  I can click on the Google search bar on the Pixel home screen, for instance -- which is personally how I always go about searching for something -- and it will be a good 5 seconds before I can actually start typing what I want to search for.

Wondering if anyone else is having this issue if they've had the phone for about half a year. It is now just a pain to use, and I find myself reaching for my phone less and less.

The screen is beautiful. Albeit, not as beautiful as the latest Samsung, but very close and the difference is negligable.

google,158,2018-11-03 12:03:44,axhng,"Lost the Pixel 3 OLED Lottery, But There Is Hope.","Pretty self-explanatory title. I was a little concerned about the issue after seeing a couple of posts here after the device started shipping in the US. It was a long wait since the launch was 1st Nov where I live.

&#x200B;

But of course, while there were plenty of reports of this issue, there were even more reports from people who are happy with their Pixel 3. So I was still excited for the phone, since I love the Pixel series of devices despite their shortcomings.

&#x200B;

Then came D-Day. My excitement immediately got extinguished when I booted up the phone. I immediately noticed the tint. I even had it on video since I was sort of filming the unboxing process to use as footage for a review I planned on doing (not anymore).

&#x200B;

Anyway, yeah. It's obvious enough that I can see it in day to day use.

(This is a wallpaper with in a uniformed grey colour BTW.)

&#x200B;

I get that things can go wrong in mass productions, but if you just look at this subreddit, you'll notice there are more complains about this issue on the Pixel 3, and almost none for the Pixel 3 XL. If the failure rate was similar, we would have seen equal amount of feedback on this issue on both devices. Which leads me to believe that there is a slightly higher chance of getting a bad display on the Pixel 3 compared to the Pixel 3 XL.

&#x200B;

Anyway, there are definitely good units out there. I've seen them myself. Units with great looking screens and uniform display with no weird tints. I also believe that a larger percentage of units out there are like that. But I just feel like the odds aren't as good as compared to the Pixel 3 XL, which really sucks for people who prefer smaller phones.

&#x200B;

The phone is definitely great. In the short time I spent with it, I really enjoyed it (apart from the screen). The camera is great, the software experience is great, speakers are loud too. I did notice the audio recording issue, but I think that's fixable with software update, and a lot of the other issues probably can be alleviated with software updates too.

&#x200B;

So if someone from Google is keeping track of this subreddit, please. Work something out. Get LG to implement tighter quality control and stop shipping bad displays out. This type of thing really ruins the experience for consumers. Needing to deal with return, worrying about whether their replacement will be the same, dealing with customer support.

&#x200B;

Maybe some time in the near future I'll try again once I feel lucky enough, or when the odds are better. But for now, I'm just going to stick with my Pixel 2.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9ttjuz/lost_the_pixel_3_oled_lottery_but_there_is_hope/

When I received the device, I discovered it was limiting itself to 5W charging. (Thanks to the Android app [Ampere](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.gombosdev.ampere))

&#x200B;

https://i.redd.it/58ul8cu0frt11.png

I emailed Anker and received the following response:

>Also, what we learned is that Google's official wireless charger can provide 10W for the newly-released Pixel 3 and Pixel XL 3, however, according to our quality engineer, Pixel sets a limitation for a third-party charging accessories and we are afraid that even our fast wireless charger can only provide 5W for these 2x devices. Our quality team is to purchase this new models to have a try, once we get a test answer, we will keep the product page updated.

So while the Anker Wireless Stand and various others on the market support 10W wireless charging, it is presently not allowed for Pixel 3 devices, outside of the Google Pixel Stand.

Additionally, the Pixel will report 'Charging Rapidly' even when getting a pathetic ~~200 amp~~ 200mA charge.

google,156,2018-10-09 19:43:38,Rockrobster43,"As we prepare for the Pixel 3, a warning about Google's phone trade-in program","Last year, I was excited to make the jump the the Pixel 2 from my Galaxy S7 Edge, and I was impressed that Google even went to lengths of offering a trade-in option. Through their trade-in program, I could mail them my old phone and receive up to a $300 refund to my credit card within ""3-5 Business Days"". Unfortunately, however, this seemingly simple process quickly devolved into a 3 month ordeal where I wasted hours on hold and never received a real refund. 

&#x200B;

I initiated the trade-in process on **October 4th, 2017**. A couple days after signing up for the trade-in, I received a flimsy padded envelope in the mail with some standard instructions. I was a little nervous about placing a $700 cell phone in an envelope and sending it through the mail, but I figured ""Google must have thought this through so I'm sure it's fine"". I followed the instructions, removing my memory card and performing a full factory reset on the phone to erase all the info (this was a no brainer - if I was going to take my chances with the envelope, there's no way that I would send my phone with a single bit of my personal information included). From there, the wait began.

&#x200B;

I waited a couple weeks and routinely checked my trade-in status that said that the trade-in processing center was still awaiting my device. I figured they must have been swamped with trade-ins so I patiently waited a couple weeks before finally calling to check in. At this point, I ended up being transferred to an agent who told me that they were sure that my old phone had been received, and it would only be a couple days before the trade-in credit would process. I made that same call every week for 6 more weeks; each time more frustrated than the last. Over the course of my calls, I came to learn that Google had outsourced their trade-in program to a separate company that operated completely externally of Google and their tracking systems. The operators had no idea how to connect me with someone at this phantom company or check on the true status of my trade-in. All they could do is file a complaint that they assured me would be routed to the external company so someone could call me back and provide me with an update. Needless to say, I never received a follow up from Google or the external company, and I was forced to keep calling them every week and work through the same steps over and over.

&#x200B;

Finally, after about 7 or 8 weeks of calls, I noticed that the trade-in status had changed to ""Phone Received"". I was so relieved that the whole process would finally come to a close, but a couple days after the status was updated, on **January 3rd, 2018 (almost 3 months after initiating the trade-in)**, I received an email saying:

&#x200B;

> After examining the device you submitted for Trade In, we found that it was different from what you indicated in our Trade In wizard.Because of this, we've adjusted your Trade In credit from $174.00 to $42.80. Look for a refund of $42.80 on your form of payment(s) in 2-5 business days.To get more info about how we evaluated your phone, see the device checklist in this email.    
>  
> Assessed device condition   
**Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge (32GB)**📷Phone received more than 30 days after initiation of trade-in📷Phone isn't factory reset 

&#x200B;

WTF?!?!?!?! To my earlier point, I made a point to completely reset my phone before sending it in. This isn't something I would overlook before shipping my device off in the mail, and being a general nerd who preorders phones, loves gadgets, and understands security risks, I certainly know what I'm doing when performing a factory reset. I know for a fact that my phone was properly reset. Also, they penalized me for the phone being received late, which was another nice kick in the gut.

&#x200B;

Of course, I called customer service AGAIN, and tried to get a direct answer on the situation. I'd read online that a lot of other people had experienced similar issues with partial credits for not resetting their devices, but I'd also read that Google had acknowledged the issue and fixed it; issuing proper credits to affected customers. I figured it must be a mistake, and asked for them to check the phone again to confirm (or ask the other company to do so). Again, they told me that they have no access to the external company, and the problem was out of their hands. They took my information down again and assured me that someone would get back to me. I never heard back.

&#x200B;

At this point, I was done calling them, waiting on hold, and being transferred several times just to be told that their customer support team was useless, so I took my complaints to email. I exchanged several emails with support agents who assured me that someone would be following up shortly to help me out.  On **January 11th, 2018,** I received the following automated note from Google:

At this point, I was ready to give up. I sent out a couple replies to agents that had responded in the past to see if this latest email meant that they were re-evaluating my old phone, but I never received a reply. Finally, without any sort of update or apology, I discovered that my Google Store account had a $175 credit. I can only imagine that someone at Google got sick of my angry emails and issued the credits to their store to shut me up, and I'll admit that it worked. Even though I didn't get the money credited back to my credit card as originally promised, and there was nothing that I wanted to buy on the Google Store worth $175, I cut my losses and gave up.

&#x200B;

Now, with the Pixel 3 coming out, I have an excuse to use the $175 store credit, but more importantly, I hope that this can serve as a warning for anyone considering Google's trade-in program.

With the Pixel I have now, things are totally different. I'm very used to the simplicity of Apple devices, so suddenly having so many options is a bit overwhelming. I had a cool messages widget that seemed to be deleted when I upgraded to Pie. 

I've done some reading and had KWLP and Novalauncher recommended, which I'm using now. Any advice on things I should do to help acclimate myself to the new OS or just things to make the phone more useful?

google,151,2018-10-05 09:34:15,marcotwigo,"So, got pixel 2 xl week ago. It's exciting! (from lumia 950)","So, I'm tech enthusiast myself and had been from childhood(thanks dad for giving me screwdriver and sending inside PC case!) thus there are many factors that come into play when I decide where to put my money at. I've used Nokia N95(loved it but Symbian was in dire need of upgrade) then Nokia 808 Pureview and loved the hell out of it - amazing camera, a lot of features, gorgeous AMOLED with always-on it had a lot going for it.

At that time I was eyeing BBOS10 as it was similar to N9 MeeGo in how it worked...and was still alive at the time. Got the Z30 - man it was great! Loved gestures and it felt so intuitive, that I'm sad to see it gone.

Then comes Lumia 950 as I really wanted that unified look and feel from my desktop and phone. Gorgeous device that works and awful 808 Snapdragon, thought Windows 10 managed to last me almost through the day! Loved the hell out of it as well and sad to see Microsoft only pushing bugfixes monthly instead of investing in W10 Mobile. It would've been awesome to have 821/835 device with proper 64-bit Win10 Mobile running on it! Shame.

&#x200B;

Now, I've been eyeing a lot of handsets - S8/9, LGV30, HTCU12, Xperia XZ2/3 and many others. Almost got the V30+ but at the last moment turned out that it wasn't in stock and who knows when be available. Next one probably would've XZ2 but I got my freelance paycheck and decided to give it a shot and buy Pixel, even though it's not officially sold over here.

I saw dozens of reviews, thoughts etc. and almost everyone hated or found design to be bland and uninspiring. Well, I'll be damned then! Right when I took it out of the box something ticked inside my brain and I fell in love with it. It's much slimmer that I thought and lies perfectly in hand! Front panel is great as well with just enough curve on the glass. My display is fine with no issues. :)

Though I've had to help set up android handsets for my family(samsung mostly) there was nothing really that excited me. Good system with it's ups and downs. Welp, I must be sucker for minimalistic but practical design - love the stock launcher and live earth wallpapers! Just the right amount of features to customize without overblowing it (though love latest samsung UX - so much good stuff!).

It's not just fluidness - there's something about it with all the little touches here and there that just excites me everytime I start to use it. After ""fluid"" Lumia 950 this is just another level! I've been sitting on the work and just using it, going from one app to other loving how fast they open! :D

Now, battery. Damn! I'm still on 8.1 as I just want to find everything there is about it and then move on to new system as multitasking screen is redesigned. One night we got home late at night and it still had 30% left! Impressive! And I've heard that Pie does wonders with it's adaptive battery and brightness.

&#x200B;

Overall, I love the hell out of this device and just can't comprehend how everyone stabs Pixel design and then goes on to say that glass is fragile and fingerprint magnet! Make up your minds people! :)

&#x200B;

The Pixel 3 XL is supposed to be displaying a pure white image.

So I got my hands on a Pixel 3 XL, and have had it for 5 days. I am unsure if this example was used extensively in pre-release, whether this is a 1 in 100000 error, whether it's because it's pre-release, or whatever. But there is very definitely screen burn-in or image retention* where the notifications bar resides. It's only marginally visible, and that too at lower brightness (it's pretty much invisible at max or close to max brightness) but after feeling that this display was absolutely fantastic, to see this is quite a bit of a downer.

Edit: So, I kept the phone off (power off) throughout the night for 7 hours, hoping it was just retention and... Nope! It's not retention.

It's no big deal but a couple of the girls are super into Apple for no reason besides the logo and think everything Android sucks. About a year ago, I was in one of her friend's house and was talking to one of her friend's husband when he noticed I had a 2XL. He immediately recognized it because he had one too as he had just made the switch from iPhone. He was really excited about it and we talked a bit about our favorite things about it such as the camera, customization, speed, etc. His wife was nearby and just rolled her eyes and said, ""That phone sucks."" We just laughed it off, the conversation shifted, and no more thought was given to it.

&#x200B;

Fast forward to a few days ago when we're hanging out again. He pulls out his phone and it's a XS Max. I wasn't really surprised as a lot of people just like sticking to what they know or just plain like iOS better which is fine. Didn't really give it a second thought but of course, one of the girls chuckled and asked, ""You switched back?"" He just smiled and said yeah. Afterwards he looked at me and said, ""The Pixel 2 sucked, man. The first one was cool which is why I got the second one but it didn't live up to the hype. I even admitted to my wife I made a huge mistake."" We went on to talk about what happened. He told me it was over heating and freezing on him all the time so he put an RMA request in to Google. All good so far. Defective units suck. Gotta get that replaced. Beyond that, the entitlement kicks in. He said Google would not approve the RMA because of a cracked screen. That frustrated him and he figured he would get the screen replaced, send the phone in, and sell the refurb one he got from Google to go back to iPhone. After he got the screen fixed, HE DROPPED IT AGAIN and it shattered before he could send it to Google. At this point, he just said fuck it and threw it in a drawer to pick up a XS Max. 

&#x200B;

So now he has a shattered, defective 2XL sitting in a drawer somewhere because it ""sucks"". I get that he got a defective unit. That's shitty. I don't get how he thought he would get a phone with a cracked screen replaced.

google,146,2019-04-14 18:52:41,MgFi,Extremely Frustrated by my OG Pixel XL & Pixel 3,"About 4 weeks ago, my OG Pixel XL (which I loved) started boot looping to the point where it became unusable.  I had bought it on release day 2016, and so, unfortunately, it was outside of the extended warranty period.

This was pretty frustrating, considering the fact that it was an $869 phone with a $99 device protection plan.  I had hoped to use it for at least another year.  Alas, it was a first gen product, so I sucked it up and bought a new phone.

Three weeks ago my Pixel 3 arrived.  Switching to the new phone was easier than I expected it could be.  Again, I loved it.  I had read all the reports of microphone issues, and of screen flashing and flickering issues, but I had decided to take another chance on Google, in hopes that these were just a vocal minority of owners having trouble.

Then, a couple nights ago, my Pixel 3 started flickering.  Today it started flashing.  It, too, is becoming unusable.

Suddenly, it's seeming like chance was never on my side.  I'm wondering about the quality control on these products, and I'm giving the reports of Pixel 3 RMAs, where the replacement phones work no better than the problem phones that were returned, a lot more credence.

I find myself wondering if I can rely on Google.  So, I'm going to initiate the RMA process for my Pixel 3...

&#x200B;

...but I've also ordered a Moto G7 to use in the mean time, because who knows how long it will be until I have a working Pixel 3 again, and who knows how long it will last.  Meanwhile, my girlfriend's 2 year old G5 is going strong, and my 20 year old StarTAC still boots up on its original battery.

I bought, and used the Pixel 2 XL the day it came out and have happily used it until receiving my Pixel 3 XL.

10/17/18

I received my new Pixel 3 XL in the mail and immediately began setup. Everything transferred over smoothly from my 2 XL without a hitch.  I started to receive texts, with the sound on, and noticed it sounding different and didn’t think much of it. After playing around a bit I opened up YouTube and starting playing a video.  This is when I noticed my speakers were not working correctly.

I went through the basic troubleshooting steps myself.  Restarted the phone, completely shut down the phone and turned it back on, booted into safe mode and even factory reset the phone. None of this resolved the issue.  This is when I contacted Google support.

Remember this is the first day the phone has been released and the same day I got the phone.

I began an online chat with customer support and went through all the troubleshooting steps with them, everything I tried myself including resetting my phone again. At the end of the chat conversation I was told that I had two options:

Option #1: They could charge me for a second phone and have it shipped to me. The charge will be removed once they receive the broken phone.

Option 2: I can RMA the phone I have now and have it sent back once it has been fixed, but I would be without a phone for a few weeks.

No brainer was to go with option 1.

I was told I would receive an email to get the shipping information for my bad phone and another email to order a replacement phone.

I received both these emails, went through both processes and ended the chat with the Google support employee.

Expected delivery date was October 21-23.

October 23

I did not receive any shipping information for my replacement phone with tracking information. I thought, no big deal I have received items in the mail without tracking information.

October 24

I wake up at 2 am and can’t get back to sleep and go through my emails and decided to contact Google support.

I begin an online chat (because my speakers don’t work) with Google support.  I was escalated to the Pixel 3 team and was told after a few minutes my device has shipped and would arrive October 24th.  I asked if I could get a tracking number and was told that I would receive an email with this information.

The day goes by and I never receive any emails with the tracking information and don’t receive the device.

I contacted Google support again via online chat. This time I get escalated to the shipping and refund team.  The employee told me he would create an investigation case and escalate this up and notify me in 24-48 hours.

October 26

Exactly 48 hours after chatting with the shipping and refund support I send an email back to the employee from that team about my case asking for any updates.

After waiting a few more hours I contact Google customer support and get sent to a different employee in shipping and refunds. They tell me to let the case owner handle the situation and contact me when they have more information.

1 hour later the investigator contacts me and tells me they are still investigating and will contact with more information as it arrives.

October 27

I contact customer support via online chat. I ask why it has taken this long to receive a new device and am “reassured” this case is being investigated and they will make a “strong” note on the case.

I tell them this is unacceptable and I should be receive a device while they are investigating, not wait for the investigation then receive a new device, like any company should do.  I am “reassured” again that this case will be taken care of.  I don’t accept this and said I want a new device shipped today or speak to a supervisor. The support employee tells me they will make another “strong” note and it will take 24 hours to receive an email from a supervisor.

At this point I am tempted to request a full refund and buy a new phone from a completely different company.  How can Google be ok with not sending a customer a working device instead of waiting for an investigation?

Screenshots and pictures can be posted for proof if there is interest.

&#x200B;

Update #1:

October 28

Canceled my replacement order, requested a refund and ordered a new phone. Should arrive by Wednesday. If it doesn't arrive or arrives broken, I will be looking for a different phone brand.

&#x200B;

Update #2:

October 30

New phone was delivered to my address but now requires an in person signature to get any pixel device from FedEx. So now to receive my new phone I must take a day off because who tf knows when postmen actually deliver. I'll update again in 3 days when they ship my phone back to Google and let everyone know what device I finally settle on to get to work.

google,146,2019-02-02 13:14:01,DSCarter_Tech,Pixel 3 + Sirui Lens Kit Review,"\*\*\*WARNING\*\*\* EXTREMELY LONG REVIEW \*\*\*WARNING\*\*\*

TLDR:

If you’re serious about your photos, but don’t want to buy a dedicated camera, the lenses from Sirui offer so much versatility and creativity to the Pixel 3 - a phone that is already one of the best point and shoots in the world. After spending a week taking photos with them on vacation, I believe they are absolutely worth every penny!

&#x200B;

Introduction:

I love photography - full stop. But I can’t stand the thought of spending $2,000 on a dedicated camera and another $2,000 on lenses and accessories. Plus, carrying all of that around doesn’t sound fun either. This is why I started using my phone’s camera as my primary shooter. The results of smartphone cameras have improved dramatically in the past 2-3 years to the point where I am proud to share my photos online with regularity. Granted, there is still only so much a fixed focal length lens on a smartphone can ever do – even if that smartphone is a Pixel. Enter, the moment lenses… (but wait, I thought this review was about Sirui lenses?!) Hang on. Sometimes we have to go back before we can go forward; we’ll get there…

Background:

Ever since the original Google Pixel was released, the camera was praised and lauded as the premier smartphone camera in the industry. At the time, I was not in the market for a new phone, but my mom was, so I suggested the Pixel to her. She loved it for more than just the camera, but every photo she sent to me just blew me away. It felt unfair that her phone took so much better pictures than mine. So, I decided to do what many of us tech enthusiasts do, and went online looking for deals on the Google Pixel. In case you don’t remember, the original Pixel did NOT have many (if any) promotions during its first 6 months on the market, making it very difficult for me to pull the trigger on a purchase – especially since I’m not a Verizon customer, nor will I ever be (that’s a topic for another review). Because of this struggle to find a deal, enough time passed to where I started hearing rumors about the Pixel 2. It was time to be patient and play the waiting game.

Months later, the Pixel 2 was announced and Google shocked the world with the highest DXO Mark score of any phone EVER – 98! (Yes, I know DXO scores are not the only way to judge camera performance, but this improvement was notable at the time). This score was up from the 89 that the original Pixel scored and knowing how impressed I was with the original, I immediately clicked ADD TO CART. The photos I was able to produce with the Pixel 2 were nothing less than INCREDIBLE. At family gatherings, family members would throw their iPhones aside and beg me to take pictures for them because my phone took such great photos. I was more and more impressed with each shot that I took with this phone. I would even try to take photos of increasingly challenging scenes just to see how far I could push the camera; intentionally breaking the rules of photography by shooting into direct sunlight, or seeking out areas of poor lighting, only to be in awe of the results every time. But these high flying feelings didn’t last forever.

Eventually, I started to get a little bored; bored by how easy it was to take a great photo, bored by how little editing was required to make each photo share-worthy, and simply bored by taking the same types of photos, just in different locations - portrait, landscape, flower, food, repeat. After a year of the greatest smartphone camera experience ever, I became eager to upgrade to the Pixel 3 to recapture that initial magic which my Pixel 2 seemed to have lost. But I was instantly disappointed; not by the Pixel 3’s camera performance, because it’s still class leading, but disappointed by the lack of “wow” factor that I felt with the Pixel 2. It didn’t have the same obvious improvement in photo quality thaw we saw from the original Pixel to the Pixel 2. I was temporarily wowed by the new Night Sight feature - which is pure magic if you ask me, but its use cases are limited and the older Pixels have that feature too. I finally turned to the internet to look for inspiration and found increasingly frequent articles and videos touting the advantages of Moment lenses.

These Moment lens advertisements \*ahem\* articles and video reviews showed me a new world of photographic possibilities that I simply could not replicate with with my Pixel 2 or 3 alone. They could take portrait photos with natural bokeh without any edge detection failures, and they could take breathtaking wide angle shots to give the scene more drama than the standard focal length lens. And finally, they had a macro lens which I thought would be a game changer. You can always zoom in/out with your feet, but the details that can be seen with a macro lens cannot be imitated. I had to have them! After browsing the Moment website for a moment (no pun intended), I was quickly turned off by the astronomical pricing for these lenses. I simply could not justify paying $100 per lens, plus another $30 for the case required to attach the lenses. After tax, it would have easily surpassed $350 for the set. The dream was dead.

Fast forward a couple months and I stumbled upon an article comparing the Moment lenses with a new lens kit from Rhinosheild. (Seriously - Rhinosheild?! Hurry up and get to the Sirui lenses already) Hang on, almost there... I was excited because these new lenses appeared to be much cheaper than Moment’s, but my excitement was quickly tempered by the side-by-side photo comparisons. IN the review, the Rhinosheild photos looked down right terrible. Somehow, their lenses made the camera’s photos look worse. I kept searching for alternatives and finally stumbled upon Sirui lenses. At the time, there were a handful of decent reviews for them and they were only a fraction of the cost of the Moment lenses. And to top it all off, they fit perfectly onto Moment brand cases. You know the drill by now… ADD TO CART!

The Review:

It took a while, but we’re finally at the review you were looking for. I purchased the Sirui 3-lens kit from Amazon for the grand total of $160 (before taxes) and I purchased the Moment case (wood grain model) for $30. Just in case you skipped the background, let me reiterate that the equivalent set from Moment (without a carrying case) would cost me over $330! The Sirui lens kit comes with 3 lenses (wide angle, portrait & macro), a hard shell carrying case, and a universal lens clip for those who don’t have a compatible phone case. Now of course, I braced myself for these lenses to be of marginal quality to help save on price. I held my breath as I opened the package and inspected the contents.

Build Quality - 5/5 Stars

To my pleasant surprise, they looked and felt very nice. The weight of the lenses was more substantial than I expected, and reassured me they were truly made of metal and glass. Although I’m not much of a fan of the bright red and blue colors for the macro and portrait lenses respectively, so far, neither appears as though the color would fade or chip easily. Scratches however are a real concern so I do not dare set these lenses down on any surface which is harder than a microfiber cloth. Speaking of which, the package includes a small microfiber cloth for cleaning the lenses as needed. It tucks away nicely into the sturdy and fairly rugged case which holds all 3 lenses. The case even has a metal clip/hook that can be secured to just about anything when traveling.

Wide Angle Lens - 4/5 Stars

The wide angle lens has a focal length of 18mm and doesn’t have that unnatural fisheye look of the original V-series LG phones. I’ve found it great to use for the following 3 scenarios:

1. When taking a picture of a landscape (obviously) or anything that’s too big or tall to fit within the view of the standard focal length. Turn the camera vertically to capture tall buildings or statues.
2. When taking pictures in a cramped space - real estate agents would love this to make any room look larger and more spacious; especially when you can’t step back any further for a better perspective.
3. When using the Pixel’s portrait mode - it allows for background blur without cropping in as far. This one isn’t my original idea. I found it on one of the reviews I read.

This lens has proven to be quite versatile; more so than I expected when I purchased it. The lens doesn’t overly distort the scene and the image looks clear and detailed almost all the way to the corners. I only gave it 4 stars though because I wish the focal length was just a hair wider. It may be personal preference, but maybe 16mm would be ideal for my use cases. I found that I could easily replicate the wide angle viewpoint in a few cases by taking just a few steps backward, making the lens less useful in those scenarios.

Portrait Lens - 5/5 Stars

I did not expect to be as impressed with this lens as I was. I was already using my Pixel 3 in portrait mode for background blur to great success, so having a dedicated portrait lens felt redundant. I was WRONG! The portrait lens creates such a smooth and natural background blur that is every bit as satisfying as a dedicated camera. The artificial bokeh (or fokeh) that smartphones are using just doesn’t compare. This lens is the largest and heaviest of the three, so it takes a bit more effort to balance the phone when taking photos. The 60mm focal length does place you much closer to your subject so taking a few steps back is often required, causing your amateur subject to wonder if you’re doing something wrong. I originally planned to give this lens only 4 stars because it does have one small “flaw” that I can find: it’s not exactly razor sharp, or at least, not as sharp as I expected it to be. Granted, it’s sharp enough, and probably just as sharp as the Pixel 3’s lens. But for no reason at all, I just expected the results to be sharper. The reason why I kept the 5 star rating, however, is because of the added benefit of the 60mm focal length. It offers a true optical zoom to the Pixel 3, which already has a fairly impressive digital zoom, and the combination of both offers significant reach that neither could provide alone. I’ve found that I can zoom in up to 8x without critical loss of detail. It’s a very capable lens. I can remove it for normal/wide angle shots, and put it back on for portrait or telephoto shots. If I could only carry one single lens, this would be the one.

Macro Lens - 4/5 Stars

Macro photography is an area where smartphones generally struggle. Software simply cannot overcome the minimum focus distance of the hardware, resulting in blurry photos when positioned too close to the subject. Some of the most dramatic photos can be achieved through macro photography, and this lens is the tool I needed to complete my smartphone photography journey. The Macro lens offers a 10x magnification (not zoom) of the subject so you can see every detail in a flower petal, drop of water, or grain of sand. It highlights details that are barely visible to my naked eye and really brings everyday objects to life. The lens even comes with a light diffusing, removable hood to prevent harsh shadows as you hold the phone so closely to your subject. Be careful though, as you have to hold the lens within 1-2 cm of the subject and risk scratching the lens by contact. I prefer to use the lens hood to help protect the lens. The moment I feel the hood touch my subject, I know not to get any closer. My only complaint is the SUPER shallow depth of field doesn’t allow me to take full advantage of the sensor area. I’m sure it is a standard characteristic of macro lenses, but I find that only the very center of my photo is in focus while the rest of the frame is quite blurry. This forces me to crop out half of my photo before sharing so that only the in-focus area is presented. With phone sensors being so small, cropping really sacrifices the final resolution of the photo.

Conclusion:

I took the Sirui Lens kit with me on a trip to Cancun recently and was able to get some fantastic shots that I absolutely would have not been able to achieve with the Pixel 3 alone. Even though my wife is pregnant, she was a willing model for me on our vacation. And if you know anything about most women, they can be very critical of how they look in photos. She came away from the experience quite impressed with the results and has even given me permission to share them with complete strangers on the internet. There is a link to an album of sample images at the end of this review.

Bottom line - if you are looking to take your smartphone photography to the next level, and aren’t willing to shell out the cash for a Moment lens system, give the Sirui lenses a shot (does that count as a pun?). As long as you don’t expect these lenses to turn your phone into a DSLR, then I doubt you’ll be disappointed. And as you can probably tell by my willingness to write this lengthy review, I certainly am not.

Bonus:

Moment Photo Case - 4/5 Stars

I am fairly impressed with the Moment Photo Case. It is offered for the Pixel 3 in three colors and I chose the black with wood grain backplate. It looked the classiest of the three to me and it certainly feels premium in the hand. It’s bulkier than the ultra thin X-level cases I typically use on my phone, but nowhere near as thick as an Otterbox Commuter or anything like that. The threaded connection for the lenses is super easy to use, requiring only a quarter turn to secure and release the lens. The lenses are also clearly marked in a way that helps you quickly align the threads. I docked it’s rating just a little for the price. In a world of $10 cases, $30 seems a bit steep, but is ultimately required to complete the experience. I also wish Moment made a battery case for the Pixel 3, as this would turn the phone and Sirui lens kit into the ultimate photography tool. Anyone who takes a bunch of photos knows the toll it takes on the battery. And due to the somewhat cumbersome nature of swapping lenses, you typically only carry them with you when you plan to take a lot of pictures. Hopefully, a Moment battery case will be developed some day. Do you think they’ll ever read this review?

You can download either the photo with edits applied or the original version.

Posting this because I only realized this today and have been avoiding making any edits before that, because I thought the modifications would be permanent.

I purchased an original Google Pixel from the online google store in October 2016. At the start of June this year it started malfunctioning; neither side of the phone are able to hear during a call, won't recognize headphones, restarts randomly.

I called google support first on 19/06/18 where they authorized an advanced return. Seven days later I had not got an e-mail confirming shipping of the device, the order was still current in 'my orders' section of the store.

I sent an email to support, I got an e-mail back saying my order had been cancelled because of an issue with the authorization hold (my bank doesn't allow holds for more than 7 days) and the order appeared as cancelled in the store.

I called support again to get options, one option suggested was to take out a new debit card from my bank so it would work. Except I had used a debit card in the first place so that wouldn't have worked anyway!

We decided to proceed with a normal return and I was told to wait for an email with a shipping label/to organise pick up of my phone. I didn't get this e-mail for a few days so I emailed again and was told they had resent it and to wait another 24-48 hours. Again I did not get the email.

I called support again and they said they had redone it and it should work and to wait 48-72 hours for the email. Again nothing, I emailed and got no response. I called again and was told someone would look into it and call me back, I did not get a call back, despite waiting over 72 hours.

Then last Wednesday I called again and they finally sent a bug report (I can't believe they hadn't already), he then said he would get back to me on Monday because it was his 'Friday' the next day and he wasn't in again until Monday. After I got off the phone I realized just how long that would be and was not satisfied.

After that I contacted support via the text chat and asked for it to be elevated to a supervisor to review, I was told I would receive a call in 24 hours. The 24 hours came and went and, you guessed it, no call back. I called again Thursday night and got put through to a supervisor who was very apologetic and promised to review it and call me back with an update first thing when he was in the next day (Friday 6pm my time).

It got to 9pm on Friday night and I hadn't got a call. So I called back and asked for the supervisor, I was told he was not in at the time and I would get a call from him when he got in to the office.

I left it until Monday night (tonight) and had not got a call back from the original bug report or from the supervisor it had been escalated too.

So tonight I called support again.... I spent a long time going through the same stuff over and over. Eventually it turned out that this is apparently an 'Australia-wide' issue that they are looking in to (How did they not know this before?!?). I was offered multiple times to 'be called back when it was fixed', given the record of calling back I have experience I did not want to take that option. I asked to speak to a supervisor, but they were 'busy' and will apparently call me back in the next couple of hours (lets wait and see).

**TL;DR = 4 weeks, dozens of emails, hours on the phone and google have not made any progress on the return/replacement of my under warranty phone**

Has anyone else experienced this kind of support? How did you get a solution?

Am I silly to think they should have escalated it to someone who can bypass this broken system?

I think I am well within my rights to go to the ACCC and consumer protection.

This won't be a typical review you might see, I'm not going to dive into the specs or technical aspects or numbers of each phone, instead I'm just going to give my honest opinion and thoughts on each having used the Note 9 since release, and now having used the Pixel 3 for also about a week. Ultimately, one of these phones will become my permanent daily driver for the next year, so I'm really going to focus on the trade-offs and sacrifices each device makes in relation to the other. 

Because ultimately, that's what this will come down to. Not to what each phone has, more so what each phone doesn't.

Having said that, it's gonna be pretty lengthy, so grab some food and a drink and let's dive in. Check the headers if you want to move forward to the respective reviews.

&nbsp;

#**Background**

So let's start with some background. I was looking for a phone replace my Pixel 2 XL. Now many of you are probably thinking, why the hell would you replace a one year old phone? Well, my philosophy is that if I'm going to pay close to $1000 on a phone, it better be damn near perfect. The Pixel 2 XL was amazing, but it was far from perfect. It had several minor flaws that by themselves didn't warrant an upgrade, but overall made me eye upgrading this year. These included things like a lack of wireless charging, a mediocre display, and aging hardware, among other things that just made me feel like I was missing out for the money I paid.

Any phone I chose had to be and feel like an upgrade in most, if not all categories, which ruled out possible contenders like the OnePlus 6, LG G7, and any imported Chinese phone (Huawei, Xiaomi, etc).

&nbsp;
#**Cue the Samsung Galaxy Note 9**
#####The Good
I've usually avoided Samsung phones since the memory of TouchWiz still haunts my pure stock Android loving soul, but after doing some research and I decided to take the leap and pre-ordered the Note 9. I've had it since day 1 and have been thoroughly impressed and satisfied. Unbelievable display, fantastic battery life, top of the line specs, ridiculous amount of storage capacity, a super useful S Pen, and a pretty great camera, and I love Samsung Pay. Honestly, I've never once thought to myself, wow, this phone isn't worth the money. 

&nbsp;

#####The Bad
Having said that, it's not perfect, though it's closer to any phone I had owned before. My main gripes come down to the software.

Firstly, coming out if the box with Android 8.1 was a huge downer, quite literally downgrading since I had been running Pie on my Pixel 2XL since the Dev previews first went live. The Samsung experience impressed me in a lot of ways, it's just jam packed with features and customization that almost makes up for the lack of Pie. But aspects of it also didn't surprise me, too. A constant barrage of notifications from random apps and monitors that I had to manually toggle off as they popped up. Lots of preinstalled bloatware, including king of the spyware itself, Facebook. Samsung's insistence that I use their ecosystem of apps means I now have two calendars, two calculators, two contacts, and two clock apps. One of the worst offenders is the stupid annoying volume limiter pop up. Goddammit Samsung, if I want to destroy my ears to Denzel Curry then that's my God-given, tinnitus-inducing right. And the most egregious software and hardware flaw of all: Bixby. 

Look. I tried. I really tried to give Bixby a try. It's great when you need it to operate your phone for you, to take a selfie, download an app, send a text. But my ideal digital assistant does more than what I'm able to do with my two thumbs. In that way, it just falls short of Google Assistant. And that's just my preference, but Samsung doesn't let you have a preference. It forces Bixby on you. It's literally embedded in the OS and it's hard, almost impossible to get rid of. And the dedicated button is the stupidest decision of all, especially placing it near the volume buttons. Even a month in, I'm still accidentally triggering it. It's honestly the biggest frustration in a phone that's so close to perfect.

&nbsp;

#**The Pixel 3 XL - worthy upgrade?**
Now, having said all that, I was, am still, really happy with the Note 9, and it's absolutely daily driver material. But, the Pixel 3 enticed me. The leaks, the buzz, the hype or hate, it was an exciting phone. It had some things that worried me, things that would undoubtedly be a step down from my Note 9. After watching the Made By Google conference, I decided to preorder it and get it into my hands. If I liked it, then I'd keep it and ditch my Note 9. If I didn't, well then $35 isn't too steep a price to demo a phone for a week.

And, well, here are my thoughts.

#####The Good
It's smooth. So smooth. Stock Android, oh how I missed you. Everything is so smooth and fluid, but more than that, it's minimalist and simple without being restricting. Instead of throwing a thousand features at your face, the Pixel 3 gives you the essentials, a few plus extras, and leaves the rest up to you. It's honestly the perfect balance and a huge step up for me from the Note 9. 

The lack of headphone jack didn't bother me before nor does it now, I've always preferred wireless headphones with mobile devices. Ironically I'm using the pair of AKGs that came with the Note 9 pre-order. Google Assistant is back, refined, and the new call screen feature is honestly one of the coolest features in any smartphone, ever. Solid battery life, now playing feature, super loud and punchy stereo speakers, wireless charging, and a flagship worthy OLED. Finally, the camera needs no more hype. It's honestly impressive how the managed to build on the already incredible P2 camera, and I think Google's portrait mode and Selfies are just miles ahead of Samsung's.

&nbsp;

#####The Bad

But whereas the Note 9 is a near perfect device with some flaws, the Pixel 3 XL is a near perfect device with sacrifices. 

Obvious sacrifices like expandable storage and headphone jack aside, the notch is, well, it's there. It's ugly on camera. It's not noticeable during usage like any other notched phone, but I much prefer Samsung's thin bezels. Most annoying of all, the notch frustratingly eats up too much notification bar room. 

4GB of RAM isn't really an issue when using the device normally, Google Maps aside, but it still feels restricting and it definitely shows itself when you have lots of demanding apps open. The gestures controls are a big ball of meh for me. I'm used to them, but I'm not happy about it. And $899 for 64GB of storage is near Apple-level absurdity, unlimited cloud storage or not.

&nbsp;

#But which one?

The bottom line is Samsung does more with the Note 9. It has a better display, expandable storage, an awesome S Pen, and a bigger battery, while keeping it with a headphone jack and notch less. On paper, it should win hands down.

But still the same time, what Google does do with the Pixel 3 XL, it does it better. Google Assistant is miles ahead of Bixby, and squeeze feature trumps a dedicated button. And you can't do Android smoother and more optimized than Google. The camera will come ahead most of the time, and has features that feel useful and impressive rather than gimmicky. The Pixel 3 is all-around a smarter phone.

&nbsp;


#Conclusion

So with that being said, which one should you pick up? Well, that depends on you. 
#####iPhone Users
If you're coming from an iPhone and want the advantages of Android without sacrificing the seamless, smooth blend of hardware and software that Apple has perfected, then go with the Pixel 3. 

If you're coming from iPhone and want the full throttle everything Android has to offer in a premium experience, then go with the Note 9 or, better yet, the Galaxy S9, which offers 95% of the features for 60% of the price.

&nbsp;

#####Android users
If you're coming from another Android, it's a lot tougher. The Pixel 3 and 3 XL, despite Google's best efforts, has become even more of a niche device to recommend. It makes so many sacrifices and has so much competition that unless you fall into the niche, you're better off with a Samsung or OnePlus. 

If you want the best software experience, the smartest AI features, and the best camera, and want to be the first for security and feature updates, then the Pixel 3 is for you. But if those things aren't important, or if having a headphone jack, best display, expandable storage, or beefier hardware are more important, then the Pixel 3 is one you can pass up without remorse.

&nbsp;

#####My new daily driver..
For me, I fall into the former category. The Pixel 3 XL excels at what I need it to. It's smart, it's gorgeous, it has the best camera and cleanest software experience, and Google Assistant seamlessly blends in to all my other Google smart devices scattered across my home. The sacrifices it makes are ones that don't affect me, and I fit squarely into it's niche. It's not a perfect phone, it's not even my perfect phone, but it's as close as we can get this year.

&nbsp;

#Final thoughts
Anyway, I really appreciate you reading my review, especially if you read through the whole thing. These were my honest, unfiltered thoughts and you're more than welcome to disagree, in fact, I'd love to hear your thoughts below.

Other phones on my radar I'm hoping to get in my hands soon are the Razer Phone 2, the OnePlus 6T, and of course, the Galaxy S10 when that's announced. I'll be doing reviews on all of these phones and more. Though I don't expect them to replace my Pixel 3 XL, I'm always going to keep an open mind. The perfect phone is out there, I just have to be patient.

google,132,2018-09-27 16:25:33,free_beer,I'm returning my iPhone XS and waiting for the Pixel 3 (x-posted to r/GooglePixel),"# Background

I've been an Android user for most of my smartphone career. I've tried to live with iPhones a few times in the past (including when the iPhone 6 came out), but but it never stuck for me.

I don't have a strong brand allegiance either way. I use an iMac and MacBook Pro for work, I have an iPad Air 2 that mostly collects dust, I have a Windows gaming PC, and my whole digital life revolves around Google services.

I wanted to love the iPhone XS for its glorious hardware, unmatched support, beautiful software, better apps, and overall premium quality.

I knew I'd be giving up Android's (still) more efficient notification system, OS navigation (back/keyboard close button, scrolling speed), Google integration, and overall flexibility.

# Dealbreaker

What I wasn't willing to compromise on was camera quality. I was hopeful that the XS would at least stack up with the Pixel 2, but what I found was that it didn't even perform better than my OG Pixel.

[Here's an album of photos I snapped with both phones.](https://photos.app.goo.gl/rCxZd189o5baBnqj9) All on pure auto settings, and all straight out of the camera. The photos go Pixel/iPhone/Pixel/iPhone. You can also open the info panel on each image to see which camera it came from.

**The iPhone camera is not bad**, and in some cases it took the better photo. In more cases, however, I found the Pixel's shots to be more colour-accurate (iPhone warms up and saturates a lot), sharper, and preserved more detail.

These things all seemed to hold up on the front-facing camera too, with the addition of some extreme skin softening which annihilates sharpness and detail in the subject's face, and can't be disabled (as far as I know).

iOS has come a long way. iPhone hardware is incredible. FaceID is MAGICAL. But $1,300 CAD is just too steep for a camera downgrade (or sidestep at the very best).

This is just my opinion, of course. Be gentle :)

**SUPER IMPORTANT EDIT:** I did not take these photos with the intention of posting them on reddit. I know I look like a mess, but I figured they'd be helpful in getting the point across ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

**LIVE PHOTO EDIT:** I understand that Live Photos are enabled. You can turn this off on Google Photos by clicking the motion icon above the photo. My understanding is that this doesn't affect the quality of the final still photo (and the camera will take/merge multiple frames to perform the Smart HDR function regardless of whether Live Photo is on).",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9jebof/im_returning_my_iphone_xs_and_waiting_for_the/

It's also surprisingly a nice upgrade from the pixel 2. I was expecting more incremental progression, but it's taken me a bit by surprise. The speakers are legit, the call screening is awesome, camera improvements are awesome and work as advertised, the build quality isn't getting *nearly* the credit it deserves (blah blah there's a bezel blah), the screen is amazing, wireless charging is so satisfying, and even the pixel buds they include are pretty awesome - as good or better than anything in the $30-$50 range on Amazon (and that's before accounting for the assistant integration. 

Don't let the anomalous quality complaints and social media anxiety worry you:  this phone is sick. Enjoy it!

Edit: someone asked about the screen playing video in basically 18:9 vs 16:9 ratios. There's no ""stretch/zoom"" option to fill the extra side space in 16:9 (probably for the better, that would ruin the videos) but the gap space is a deep OLED black so it blends in perfectly well with the edges of the phone. Here are two samples (sorry, it's a different image, I didn't have samples of identical video in the two formats)

First off, the problems after using it for a day.

I'd definitely say that the speaker problems are not exaggerated. They definitely sound muffled to me, and the vibrations are really apparent sometimes. But in the end, they still sound better than my previous phone, and I'm not bothered by the vibrations, so they're at least better than I expected. I'm not a pro so I'm not gonna guess whether it's a hardware or software problem, but I would recommend that people who are picky about audio to just stay away from this phone until it's clearly fixed. On the other hand, if you're not picky about audio, I think you'd be just fine.

Then we have the memory management issues. It's real, to me at leasr. I have definitely noticed more app redraws and background kills than my previous phones. Disabled battery management for some apps, hoping it will ease the situation. I definitely want this fixed or at least more carefully tuned.

Overall, the problems seem to be in line with what I have read on here. So it looks to me like it's not just a bad batch or a defect or bad QC (for the XL, at least). Just design flaws.

Other than that, I love or otherwise have no issues with the rest of the phone. I love the the screen, the camera, and the haptic feedback. The notch is much less of a bother than expected, but its existence is still pretty meaningless to me.

I have been using Android Auto pretty much religiously the last year and I can't live without it. 

Sadly... My phone (Pixel XL 2) has stopped connecting to my car. My boyfriend uses the same USB as me and has no issues at all.  

I've tried USB debugging/Revoking USB Authorizations, Reinstalling AA/Clearing my car from the app, and now a full factory reset of my phone. I will also add that this started around the same time I downloaded the latest version of the Android P beta (DP4). I also opted out of the the Beta with no fix for AA. 

The phone charges perfectly fine and I can connect to my PC and transfer data so, im seriously confused as to why this is happening. I'm all out of ideas before I try to get a replacement so any help would be much appreciated!

I was between the 2 XL, 3 XL & Note 8. Both the Note & 3 looked good, but one of the things that turned me off about them was their size. They are phones that are really noticeable in your pocket, & can even stick out. 

So I decided for the 2 XL, which is a bit smaller, & purchased it yesterday from the google store for $699. I was considering getting it from ebay for cheaper, but I like buying things from the official source, & didnt want any warranty issues with the vendor.

I pretty much had the same exact issue as reddit user trickinit [His Google Trade in nightmare.](https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/8lbzq7/my_google_tradein_nightmare/)

Long story short. I traded in my used iPhone 7 128gb which was in (like new) Condition, using their Trade-in kit back in October 2017. Only to find out the phone did not turn on during their inspection. Then was issued only $80 when the original trade-in offer was $344 [screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/MnlMRCB.png) I've chatted/called Google Support numerous times only to get the same run around. I recently contacted Google Support in hopes to get my issue resolved after seeing reddit user trickinit's post.  Well, It has been more than 48 hours, I did not receive a call nor an email regarding this issue. They have been ignoring me since December of 2017. I've even mentioned about trickinit's Reddit post. I just wish someone from Google Support can see my post/comments. 

""Sandra: Thank you so much, Cenon. Helping you is my utmost priority."" 

[Screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/z3byEhA.png)

google,129,2019-05-09 15:31:37,Wingul_Nova,Update after almost 2 days with Pixel 3A,"This will be the future of phones. I am convinced. Coming from high end phones like S10+ and 10XS Max, they basically seem like a complete rip off now. Here a quick list so far of notes.

1. I honestly forgot how nice it is to use a phone one handed.
2. Battery life is quite good. About 5.5 hrs of screen on time per charge (med-heavy usage)
3. Apps load a tad slower than flagships. Not a big deal in my book.
4. Camera is stellar! Flagship killer feature right here.
5. Wifi and mobile data is fast. Not blazing though, again good for the price point.
6. I prefer the polycarbonate build. I kinda like the throwback feel vs the glass.
7. Pure Android

A note on network: I have the unlocked version of the phone. My network is ATT. It appears to me you are able to get a watered down version of HD voice out of the box.

1. I appear to be getting HD Voice as the symbol appears during the call if the other party also has HD voice.
2. VOLTE is working.
3. Mobile hotspot is working
4. Wifi calling is enabled, however, you can't switch it to Wifi preferred. It always uses mobile preferred and you can't change it.
5. No Visual VM built into the dialer. Must get ATT VVM App (or google voice)

&#x200B;

EDIT#1: The call screening feature maybe the best feature I've ever had on any phone, especially now these days with so many robo calls. It's basically like giving it right back to them. IF this were on every phone, regardless of mnfg, I don't see how robo callers/scammers make it.

It's on by default, but there is a feature that makes the phone save the location of where a WiFi network was connected to. Using this info, the phone can do something really cool.

If you turn your WiFi off when you are away from a saved network, when the phone detects that you are back at a location with a saved network, it turns WiFi back on automatically. I can't tell you how many times on my old phone that I would use gigabytes of data because I would forget to turn my WiFi on when I get home, but with Pixel is just turns on automatically.

I have unlimited data so it was no biggie for me, but

1) WiFi uses less battery than Data and 

2) WiFi is faster

so this even gives benefits to us with unlimited plans.

Pulling up to go to the app draw is awful, one really long and overstretched swipe or an awkward clunky double swipe.

The intrusion of an unnecessary black or white bar at the bottom, is by far the most annoying. By taking up some rather large screen real estate. Some that, if removed would improve the immersion of the UI and the experience would be greatly enhanced.

Don't get me wrong though because i absolutely love this phone.The vibration motor is really punchy and clicky.
The camera is by the best far on any smartphone.
The speakers are loud, clear and have really tight bass.
Battery is much better after the rather large 
100+ MB November security update. This gives me hope for the amount of resources Google is investing in both the 3 and 3XL.

I am not talking about the phone too much because it seems that it's just an upgrade to the current iPhone X. But still its cool. (7nm Chip SOC it's really cool in particular)

I am a GOOGLE FAN, I have if not all, MANY of their devices. But even I accept that Apple has become a formidable option. Making me even think about switching.

The phone, watch and Air Pods complement each other AMAZINGLY. I want something like that from Google, but sadly they are so fragmented and.....""glitchy"" that its not even funny. As a Pixel 2 XL owner, sometimes I feel like a constant ""beta tester"". And if the notch that has been coming up in the leaks recently are true for the Pixel 3 XL, then I see Google on a really bad spot, not only copying Apple, but BADLY doing it. The Google Pixel buds are...not good according to everyone that I have read that has had it. And it seems according to Tom's Hardware that there will not be a Pixel Watch this year. For someone like me that its looking for an even bigger integration besides their Google Home, Apple seems to be a compelling option nowadays, and then come back to Google when their hardware and software mature a little bit more.

Please take this from the heart of a GOOGLE and PIXEL fan. This it why it bothers me so much how ""behind"" Google is in so many things. They want to do a lot, but don't focus on one thing and do it well. They rather ""half-ass"" everything that they do, and move on to new tech and software. Exhibit A: Hangouts, Allo, etc... Exhibit B: Google Play Edition phone, Nexus and hopefully the end of the switching: Pixel.

Let's see what do they do on their next announcement, but my expectations for Google are super low at this point.

EDIT: I am not criticizing my amazing phone. In fact I love it and AGAIN i am a google fan and UNDERSTAND EVERYTHING THAT COMES WITH IT. But they need to get their stuff together.

google,114,2019-05-02 12:21:48,DNPWWO,Looks like the Pixel 3a specs are close to the Pixel 2,"The specs for the 3a are just slightly under pixel 2 insofar as performance goes. 

The 3a has a headphone jack. So I suspect it isn't water resistant/rated IP67 either. ~~But who knows, perhaps it is.~~

* Pixel 3: Snapdragon 845

* Pixel 2: Snapdragon 835

* **Pixel 3a: Snapdragon 670** 

* Pixel: Snapdragon 821

The Snapdragon 670 is a 2018 chipset, and has better performance than the 821, but offers less performance and speed than the 835.

GPU (graphics and video processing) is significantly weaker in the 3a vs the Pixel 2. Adreno 615 vs Adreno 540.

Ram, cameras, etc is pretty much the same as the Pixel 2 (the 3a rear dual pixel 12.2MP camera will be slightly better than the 12.2MP Pixel 2 rear. Front 8MP camera is the same on both).

Plastic vs aluminum.

The 3a display does not use Gorilla Glass 5 (like the Pixel 2 and 3) it uses Dragontrail Glass which is considered more resistant than Gorilla Glass 2, but breaks more easily than Gorilla Glass 3 (drop tests).

The Pixel 3a will not support Daydream VR: “Resolution and framerate” issues make the phone incompatible with Daydream.

**Snapdragon SoC benchmarks**

> the [670] SoC, running on a device with 6 GB of RAM and Android 8.1 Oreo, recorded an impressive single-core score of **1863**, and a multi-core score of **5256**.

 > The Snapdragon 835, for example, averages about **1915** on single core tests, and **6485** on multi-core. 

> The 6 series Adreno 615 GPU (Snapdragon 670) performs at 358 billion operations per second (358 Gflops).

> The 5 series Adreno 540 GPU (Snapdragon 835)  is 1.5 times faster than the Adreno 615 GPU (Snapdragon 670) at 567 billion operations per second (567 Gflops).

**TL;DR**


**The plastic 3a has a slightly better rear camera, but has a marginally slower, and less powerful Snapdragon SoC (CPU and GPU processors), which translates into a performance/speed hit in comparison to the Pixel 2.**

**The 3a brings back the original Pixel 3.5mm headphone jack**

**The 3a Lacks IP67/IP68 water resistance**

**Due to resolution and framerate issues, the 3a will not support Daydream VR**

google,120,2018-07-24 19:37:13,ValarMorgouda,I'm having trouble getting Google to keep their promise about replacing my girlfriend's pixel. Not sure what to do.,"Hey guys! This is going to be a bit of a long one but thank you for reading, and any advice would be appreciated. 

At the beginning of this year my girlfriend's Pixel started having microphone problems and boot looped on a couple occasions.  We contacted Google and it turned out that it was out of warranty but the phone fixed itself in the end. 

Fast forward a few more months and the problems started again. It started with the microphone and the headphone jack not working, and then boot looping started again. I knew that the phone was out of warranty but I called Google for her because it's kind of bullshit to only expect a $700 phone to only work for a year +. I was very kind and I asked the lady if she could do anything about it. She told me that if we took the phone to uBreakiFix and they deemed it to be a factory defect, Google would replace it. I wish that I had gotten some kind of written confirmation of this, but I didn't. I didn't think we'd have so much trouble getting Google to keep their word. We took the phone in and it was indeed deemed to be a factory defect. 

https://imgur.com/a/DuZAh0p

We made sure that this was a factory defect and not just a user created damage:

https://imgur.com/a/dnugDdp

We went back to Google with this and they change their tune completely. They said that they do not ever replace devices out of warranty. I told them that even if it's not their policy, we were made a promise. They told us they would investigate and see if this promise was really made. This was their response following their investigation, which is utter BS. Apparently they are already forgetting the whole Nexus 6p battery fiasco.. 

https://imgur.com/a/CyYVQPu

At this point, I called in and stopped being nice.. I demanded for them to tell me what the lady that I spoke to said. They refused to confirm or deny that she made the promise. We spoke to managers and regular tech support for a week, day after day. They completely walled us out and only offered to talk to uBreakiFix and have them repair the phone, but she'd have to pay. 

My girlfriend finally went to pick up her phone from uBreakiFix and the guy that worked on her phone stated that he saw pixels come in frequently with motherboard issues and Google has always been quick to solve the problem since it was a factory defect, even if the phone is out of warranty.

Personally, I was always a Nexus person, owning every single one since the Nexus One, and bought a Pixel as well, but after this experience, I don't think I ever will again. I've never been more angry at any company before. 

It's been a few weeks or so since this ordeal. We stopped pursuing it for a while because emotions were running high and we needed a break. My girlfriend is low on funds though. She just had a surgery and has many thousands due in medical bills, so she can't afford to just let this go.",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/91km86/im_having_trouble_getting_google_to_keep_their/

There's still a little bit of buzzing at low volumes with some media but you have to put your ear to the speaker to hear it. Hopefully Google will keep fixing it with more updates but for now it's definitely enough to keep me from doing an exchange...

In my opinion this is a hardware issue but Google's found a way to reduce the frequency that was causing the issue (something like 215Hz I think but I could be wrong) and reduce the buzzing to the point where it's usable. Still a shame that there's any issue at all, I'd like to see Google have better quality control before shipping out their devices...


TL;DR: Update fixed buzz enough where it's barely audible, but it's probably still a hardware issue that's been optimized with software tweaking

*EDIT*: DRASTICALLY IM SORRY JEEZ

*EDIT 2*: A few people have pointed out that the speaker now sounds different depending on the volume.

Google is not and will not have adds on your lock screen or phone application. It is an application doing this. I have seen two different applications one was a random ""easy QR scanner"" the other was a ""Easy document maker"".  I did find an quick way of locating the offending application. When you get the advertisement immediately bring up recent apps. In Android P the top of the card with the add will have an icon. Long press the icon and it will have the name of the app. Go into apps in setting and uninstall the offending application. this was the quickest way I have been able to figure out what the hell was doing it.

At the time I only had the Pixel for a few days and the Xs since launch. Someone asked what I preferred and at the time thought it was equal. But, in the last week I've seriously considered selling my Xs as Google and the Pixel are that good. I've barely even touched my iPhone since I got the Pixel. 

The only things I'll really miss are the screen on the Xs as it renders colors more towards my preference and has a little more real-estate, the tap to scroll to top, better video recording quality and the fact my parents use Facetime to talk with the Grandkids. Then some of the things I would have missed were solved with 3rd party apps; mainly the gestures, which I use Fluid NG and my Airpods until I found Air Battery. I'll give the hand to the iPhone on battery but, it's not that drastic. Plus, I understand the decreased battery on the Pixel has a lot to do with how much more the apps can do in the background and service wise.  I also think the adaptive battery is getting better at learning my behavior so it might somewhat even out. I did have to chase a few rogue apps but that is fixed now.

I'm just blown away at how far Android has come since my last one which was the S3. The camera is insane and pictures are what I lean towards over video. The interaction with google assistant and the ability to choose default apps. Notifications on all apps are leaps and bounds over the iPhone. Even, how much less I even find myself using my computer because of the file management handling has surprised me. All this week my computer has only been used for gaming and a few browsing sessions. Anyway, if you have any questions feel free to ask.

I'm not here to bash the iPhone as I think it's still a great device.  I'm glad Apple is a player and continues to help fuel competition among the phone vendors. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9w9d1a/seriously_thinking_of_selling_my_iphone_xs/

* **Panda / Stormtrooper** - For the OGs that have been in the Nexus/Pixel line for awhile and appreciate this unique and signature colorway for the Google phones.
* **Kinda Blue** - For the modern/minimalist/matte/subtle/subdued/Braun design aesthetic.
* **Gradient** - Maybe this can serve people who want something different, a bit more vibrant, and something of-the-moment. Use it to replace the Really Blue/Abundantly Red flat/bright colors they put out every year that don't really have much fanfare?

Specs for 3 are the same except for the physical attributes. Interestingly it claims that the batter is bigger (3915mAh) compared to the 3XL (3430mAh). Not sure if I believe this. 2915 seems more likely. Also shows security/unlock as 3915mAh instead of fingerprint sensor, so there is probably a mistake

google,111,2019-04-29 07:32:38,alivepunk,My experience switching from iPhone to Pixel. Trade-in disaster.,"It was time to update my smartphone so I decided to go to Apple in person and they offered quite a bit more than Google to trade-in my old iPhone but I ended up going for the new Pixel to try something new and refreshing.

After researching online and finding a few negative reviews I thought ""It can't be that bad, it's Google... I must be getting biased search results"". So I documented all the trade-in process, took photos identifying my phone's perfect conditions, IMEI, Address and shipping package. I made sure the box for shipping was well sealed and safe. The shipment arrived on time without problems according to the website.

A few days later I receive a mail that the screen of the iPhone they received was damaged and they could only merely give me $21. I contacted Google Support and sent them all the proof of perfect conditions of the phone and the package, that I honored my part yet they declined to honor theirs and to provide any proof of a damaged screen. I basically got scammed. They used their good name so that you trust their process and then they screw you over.

I guess it was my mistake to not listen to all the other negatives reviews. Hope the next person knows better than me.

&#x200B;

As to the phone, it's very nice and I love the camera. It's a bit tough that there is a much smaller market for accessories for the Pixel in comparison to the iPhones, it makes it much more complicated to make everything compatible.

The whole experience left me a sour taste, if you are going to buy a Pixel make sure to give your old phone to a family member or sell it by yourself. Do not trade-in. Hope my experience can help other people.

&#x200B;

Edit: For anyone interested, the trade-in kit was a box not an envelope. (First-Class Package Return Service)

Here's the package (I deleted sensitive info like name/address/IMEI for obvious reasons).

The glass backing feels great, the rounded edges are smooth. I enjoy the removal of the 'panda' effect, I think it makes the phones look more mature. That's my word for the Pixel 3 and 3 XL - mature.  It's the first generation of Pixel where the phones actually feel and look premium across the board, big notches and bezels et al. 

Thoughts on the Pixel 3: 

Definitely less controversial than the XL. It's a noticeable upgrade from the 2 and it really is a reasonable upgrade option, even coming from a 2XL to the 3. High quality but the big bezels on a $799 phone in 2018 is a bit dated. They did a great job of rounding out the display edges and the screen is gorgeous. 

Thoughts on the Pixel 3 XL:

That notch isn't that bad, I hate the bottom chin though. The notch in my opinion was kind of cool after using it for a while. It creates a natural split of the top status bar and the display below in a way that makes it easier to focus on either or when desired. The screen quality is 100x better than it was and it feels much more premium than the 2 XL did. The past 2 Pixel generations felt like the Nexus 6P to me and the new generation feels more in line with Apple quality. 

This phone makes the $50 less 2XL seem very overpriced and the thought that the iPhone XS Max is $200 more is just insane. 

Overall, definitely worth the upgrade and I think that regardless of which you go with, you'll be happy you did. I had to get 2 Pixel stands for the bedroom and studio, too. They're amazing! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9o7py5/i_went_from_maybe_to_definitely_after_30_minutes/

So google had me do a out of warranty diagnosis with [uBreakiFix](https://support.google.com/store/answer/7182296?hl=en). After they did they diagnostic they called me and stated the battery is dead and I need to replace it, I said hold off on the repair and I will just take the phone back. I was out of town and had my parents pick up the phone, so when I get back this is what my phone looked like.

It honestly doesn't look like it is my phone.

""Google has circled back with us for some clarification. While only the Pixel Stand will charge the Pixel 3 wirelessly at full speed right now, a certification process is underway through the company's Made for Google program to allow third-party chargers to operate in the same manner, at full 10W speeds.

These certified chargers will take advantage of the protocol currently used by the Pixel Stand to similarly charge the Pixel at 10W. Belkin's got one in the works, and presumably we'll see other accessory manufacturers follow suit.

While the third-party chargers will be formally certified and able to operate with the Pixel 3 at full speed, Google's unique charging UI will remain exclusive to the Pixel Stand.""

I open it, and inside is the packaging for the phone. I open the packaging, and while doing so, I discover that the tape that would normally hold it closed had been broken.

I see a lot of posts with people saying they didn't get the XL specifically because of the notch and I just don't get it.

I loved my Nexus 5x, the camera, the size and the price. But it's battery was getting unworkable, I was having random memory corruption affecting photos and podcasts. And I'd already had it replaced under warranty with the dreaded bootloop.Pixel 3a is a worthy replacement. A few of observations:

* The installation process slurped all the data and many settings from my last phone (via an included OTG dongle) which is impressive! Never managed to do this before as my last phone died before being replaced by 5x!
* I am finishing the day with 59% battery life which is good (rather than recharging at 3pm).
* The camera is nice, but not a mind blowing upgrade from the Nexus 5x. It focuses better (seems to choose the best focused from a stream of shots?) and is a bit faster. But things often take on weird colour hues (maybe it's the screen adaptive setting..?), or the HDR software isn't as subtle as it was on the Nexus 5x. Low light performance is next level though.
* The onboard speakers are much nicer than the Nexux 5x. And actually usable for podcast listening at home.
* The screen is slightly narrower which makes the keyboard smaller. Can we just stop copying apple with longer and longer screens. Please. Make em wider again so the keyboard isn't tiny.
* Yay headphone jack!
* Yay nice screen without weird notches.
* So fast!

My guess personally is the camera or something has a memory leak (maybe AR?) that needs to be fixed. 

Please restart your phone and see if your experience improves. Until Google fixes it a reboot is best way to keep things running smoothly. 

EDIT: To be clear my point is that this seems more unintentional/bad code rather than Google being overly aggressive with memory management and killing apps left and right for fun.

google,99,2018-10-18 17:20:16,slgerb,Pixel 2XL vs Pixel 3 - Initial Impressions,"I've been super stoked about getting the Pixel 3 to upgrade from my Pixel 2XL. Main reasons to upgrade were the advertised Top Shot feature and the smaller form factor (and no notch!). Now, I'd like to share with you guys some of my initial impressions on the differences between the two, places where the 3 is noticeably better, where the 2xl is better, and things in between.

NOTE: This is only an initial impression after a day's use of the 3. I've had the 2XL since last November.

**Where the Pixel 3 is better:**

* **Build Quality** - With the smooth-etched rear glass, the Pixel 3 feels much more premium. Neither are too slippery, but I feel more secure holding the Pixel 3 (might be due to smaller form factor as well). The power button, although still plastic, has a less harsh press and a muted tone. Love the blank left edge.

* **Speakers** - Very clear improvement hear. Louder and much less tinny. Great all-around but still not something I'd use as a music source.

* **Display** - The slightly smaller side bezels make a huge difference! Overall, images and backgrounds look crisper and cleaner.

* **Haptic Feedback** - Pixel 3 is the first phone I plan on keeping the haptic feedback on. It just feels nice, the right amount of vibration with a less harsh audible sound.
* **Photos** - No doubt better shots with HDR+ and HDR+ Enhanced enabled. The new depth controller is great for portrait mode (believe it will come to Pixel 2 lineup as well). Top Shot is a letdown though, and probably one reason for me considering returning the phone.

**Where both are just as good:**

* **Design** - I absolutely adore the panda design. Probably my favorite design of all phones. The double tone on the 3 is still nice though (I have the clearly white), and the more subtle accent power button is actually nicer in person. Top and Bottom bezels looks to be the same size.

* **Video** - Both have EIS and OIS, both shoot 4k@30fps. The Pixel 3 really shows no improvement here, at least not in my eyes. Both are still decent.

* **Charge Speed** - Both charge up quite fast. Haven't done a direct comparison, but based on my regular usage, I didn't notice much of a difference.

* **Performance** - No discernible performance speed differences between the phones. Both are really fast. Granted, I'm not a super heavy user. Others might see a noticeable difference. For basic uses, not so much.

* **Voice Call** - No problems on either phone!

**Where both are just as bad:**

* **Black Crush** - Ouch, this one hurts the most. One of the main reasons for me to upgrade the 2XL was to finally get past the black crush problem since I use low brightness regularly. Unfortunately, the Pixel 3 is just as bad. Take a look at the tests yourself (both on natural setting):

  Pixel 3 - [100%](https://i.imgur.com/EtSnWYK.jpg), [50%](https://i.imgur.com/b8xk5vJ.jpg), [0%](https://i.imgur.com/mEhntDT.jpg)

  Pixel 2XL - [100%](https://i.imgur.com/vzfjihE.jpg), [50%](https://i.imgur.com/KYUy1mU.jpg), [0%](https://i.imgur.com/vUwur2u.jpg)

* **Low Light Video** - To me, both are practically unusable. Too much grain and stutter.

**Where the Pixel 2XL is better:**

* **Sheer Size** - A clear benefit to the larger form factor. I'm getting older and it's getting tougher to read small text. I've been doing more zooming in with the Pixel 3 that I did with the 2XL.

* **Audio Recording** - What the heck happened here? The audio recording playback on the Pixel 3 is quite bad, extremely tinny. Some say that there's a lot of software with noise cancelling causing an issue. If this can be fixed with software, great. But as of now, Pixel 2XL is better and that's not exactly saying much.

* **Battery Life** - This one surprised me. Some reviews are saying that Pixel 3 is getting better battery life than the 3XL. Maybe I'm just unlucky. My 2XL lasts noticeably longer. Even at night, the 2XL preserved more battery when left unplugged. Both have ambient display on. Might be an optimization issue? Granted, both still gets me through the day without charging. Time will tell.

Well, that's about what I can think of right now after using the Pixel 3. Sorry for the long read! But to close, I am mildly impressed with the new phone. Is it a keeper? I don't know just yet. I like it but the price tag is a tough pill to swallow when considering all of the improvements and lack thereof. 

I hope this helped some of you on making a more informed purchase! ",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/9pbaqp/pixel_2xl_vs_pixel_3_initial_impressions/

google,100,2018-10-16 05:46:16,SarahQGFB,I'm really concerned about the audio quality of video on the Pixel 3,"I've heard that the Pixels are terrible for audio, and it looks like they haven't improved it this year. The first 10 seconds of Supersaf TV's camera comparison say sit all:

I really don't want to move to iPhone, but this is quite an important feature to me as I film a lot of video. Is the Samsung S9 better at this?


I have a small hope that Google will push a software update to activate another mic but I highly doubt it.

google,97,2018-05-26 18:36:04,gordongoodtimes,Android Messages on OG pixel has become unreliable... Anyone else?,"It doesn't download texts, or does so out of order. It gives multiple notifications for the same text, WHILE I'm reading said text. Seems to really be a mess. I deleted app cache and data. Verizon messages works fine. I prefer UI of Messages but wondering if other Pixel users are having this issue?

UPDATE: Deleted my biggest text thread (thousands of messages) and it fixed everything.  

UPDATE 2 ON 8/15: back to unreliable. I love Messages for Web but the app on my phone gives the ""not responding"" pop-up frequently, messages don't send, MMS don't download... Tried archiving hundreds of threads and not any change. ANY OTHER TIPS?
