There are so many bad experiences on this sub that it's almost hard to believe.  I started with DTV Now when they launched and I agree it was a buggy, choppy mess then.  It was bad enough that I left and did trials with PS Vue and Sling for about 6 months.  PS Vue was far less stable than the current iteration of DTV Now.  When I came back, it has been pretty smooth sailing since then.  I have 3 FireTV Sticks (Gen 2) and a wired FireTV (Gen 2) that have all been pretty smooth sailing since then.  I don't see DTV Now breaking up or stuttering any more than NetFlix, Amazon Prime, YouTube, my local media server and is definitely more steady than my roof mounted antenna with HD HomeRun.

I even went on the Beta program for a few months for the DVR and the only thing I could ever report was that the app locked up on the welcome screen.  Once it was on, it was fine.

47,2018-05-23 02:08:23,VGinNYC,DTVN+AppleTV+HDHomeRun+ChannelsApp = Excellent Cable TV Replacement,"Hi, all. I've been a DTVN subscriber since it rolled out in late 2016 (still on the $35 Go Big Promo). I've been using an OTA antenna hooked up to my TV's coax connector to watch my local channels that are not available on DTVN. However, this has not been optimal since a) I would always need to pick up a different remote to switch TV inputs in order to access my OTA channels; and b) I had no online guide for my OTA channels.

After doing much research, I finally purchased an HDHomeRun Connect Duo ($99) and the Channels App for Apple TV ($25), and I have to say that I am quite impressed with this setup. The Channels app for Apple TV is everything the DTVN app should be! Easy to navigate, quick response time, flawless execution (although there is room for improvement). The Channels App was put together by a couple of software developers whom AT&T should have hired a long time ago!

Here are some of the features I enjoy about this setup:

- If you place the Channels App on the top row of the Apple TV menu, my Channels App favorite channels thumbnails (with TV show icons of what is currently playing) are displayed on the Apple TV top shelf. If I want to go to that channel and watch the program, I just select it from the top shelf.

- Changing channels on the app takes about 1 or 2 seconds for the picture to start streaming ... very quick! Note that I have both the HDHomeRun and Apple TV connected to my router via ethernet cable.

- You can pause/rewind/ff live TV in the app. The app uses the Apple TV's memory to store the buffer. The app web site claims you can pause for up to 90 minutes (I have only tested about 10 minutes worth of pausing, and I can say it has worked extremely well). Scrubbing through the video backwards and forwards shows the corresponding video segment, so there is no guessing as to where to resume playback.

- Clicking on the left side of the remote's trackpad rewinds the live stream by 7 seconds; clicking on the right side fast forwards by 30 seconds. You can change the number of seconds for both options in the config menu.

- No extra subscription fees. The Channels App provides 4 hours of TV program guide. There is a DVR option for $8/month that gives you a full 21-day guide, but I haven't explored that. There are other DVR options that work with the HDHomeRun unit if you wish to implement a DVR solution.

- Double-clicking the Apple TV remote play/pause button changes to the previously viewed channel. I wish DTVN did this!

Here are a couple of articles that explain my setup in more detail:

https://appleinsider.com/articles/18/03/13/how-to-get-television-to-your-apple-tv-without-using-a-streaming-service

https://www.imore.com/how-watch-live-tv-your-apple-tv-without-cable

I am not affiliated in anyway with either HDHomeRun or Channels; I just wanted to share my OTA-viewing configuration with my fellow DTVN subscribers who may be missing locals in their respective DTVN markets. Of course, if you have lousy OTA reception in your home this post will not interest you, but if you have solid OTA reception, this might be a great solution for you.

48,2019-05-03 04:07:40,moricons_dll,*Guide* How To Sideload Apps (like Prime Video) on the Gen 2 Osprey Beta Box,"Just got my Gen 2 box via FedEx today and spent some time poking and prodding at it via ADB (Android Debugging Bridge).

USB side-loading has been locked down by AT&T via removing the auth activity required to give an app (like a file browser) installation permissions. On previous Android versions this was just a global flag, but in Oreo (Android 8) it's authorized per individual app.

&#x200B;

**The good news is it's still possible via ADB even without root:**

1. Download the APK you want from a safe source. (Amazon Prime for ATV is available here -> [https://rawapk.com/prime-video-android-tv-apk-download/](https://rawapk.com/prime-video-android-tv-apk-download/)).
2. Install ADB on your PC if you don't already have it -> [https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html](https://developer.android.com/studio/releases/platform-tools.html) .
3. On your Osprey box press the remote's HOME key and select the SETTINGS ICON.
4. Scroll down to SYSTEM -> GENERAL -> SYSTEM SUMMARY.
5. With SYSTEM SUMMARY highlighted, press the OK button on your remote repeatedly until ""You are now a developer"" appears on the screen.
6. On the same menu, scroll down to DEVELOPER OPTIONS.
7. In the DEVELOPER OPTIONS menu, scroll down to USB DEBUGGING and enable it.
8. Press the EXIT key on your remote.
9. Get the IP Address of your Osprey box by checking it under SETTINGS -> SYSTEM -> NETWORK -> NETWORK SUMMARY
10. Connect to your Osprey box via ADB on your PC by typing ""adb connect INSERT YOUR OSPREY BOX'S IP ADDRESS HERE"" at a terminal or command prompt.
11. A box will pop up on your Osprey's connected TV screen asking for permission to allow debugging from your PC. Select OK.
12. Now type ""adb install INSERT APK LOCATION ON YOUR PC HERE"".
13. You should get a success message in ADB upon completion. When you're done installing all the APKs you need by repeating Step 12, type ""adb disconnect"".
14. For security purposes, it's best to turn off USB DEBUGGING in DEVELOPER OPTIONS once you finish.

&#x200B;

Your installed applications should now show up under ""Apps"" in your Home Menu.

Congrats! You now have a kick ass Android set-top box that can run just about anything you need.

31,2018-07-02 16:57:07,,A realistic look at the DTVN price increase,"One thing that is different with this versus what companies like YouTube TV and Sling TV are doing..... those companies are simply grandfathering in prices that customers had before a price increase.

That isn't what the GoBig Promo was about when it first rolled out in 2016. The regular price at the time for the GoBig was $60 for the service, and they were offering people a limited time offer to get the GoBig package for $35, which was a $25 discount off the normal price, to sign up. Right from the first day, DTVN always said that the GoBig promo package would see the same increases as the other plans, but that you would keep your discount.

Now that the regular price is going up to $65, we are still keeping our discount...but now $25 off (which is what the original discount amount was for the GoBig promo) of $65 is $40.

Hey, I'm not happy about the increase either..especially since they are having issues with the locals and the DVR is still in beta.

We have a nice sound system, and it was extreme enough to rattle the windows, startle us, and cause hearing pain. Using my phone I clocked the average dB of the content we were watching to hover around 70, but would jump to an average of 90 dB during ads with peaks as high as 97 dB. I contacted support to report my complaint and concerns and they escalated my request and stated I should see an immediate resolution when watching shows.

Since contacting DTVN, pre-recorded shows no longer populate with loud ads and the countdown, and instead, standard ads play without the countdown, and more importantly, the volume issue is resolved. If you have this problem, I suggest contacting DTVN and express your concern about the ad volume.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/boutwp/psa_for_loud_commercials/,positive,0.2621

Well in a move that both stunned and pissed pretty much everyone off, AT&T seems to care again and now we're being pushed to sell this garbage once more. So don't be surprised if your local store rep brings it up next time your there for an upgrade.

&#x200B;

I've noticed general slowness moving between menus and apps etc, and figured that changing the animation rate would give a noticeable boost in UI speed. So if you want, follow the directions below and set your animation speed accordingly.

&#x200B;

1) Enable Developer options per u/moreicons_dll thread [HERE](https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/bk483i/guide_how_to_sideload_apps_like_prime_video_on/)

2) Press the HOME key and then go to SETTINGS

3) Then go to SYSTEM -> GENERAL -> DEVELOPER OPTIONS

4) In the DEVELOPER OPTIONS menu, scroll down until you see the Window, Transition, and Animator duration scale.

5) Default value for these settings is 1.0x. I prefer 0.5x as the animations and transitions are still present, but quicker. You can disable to get rid of them entirely if you'd like.

*Amazon APP Store APK*

***Steps are fairly simple to sideload:***

1.  *Enable the Installation from ""Unknown sources"" under the Settings\>Secutiy \(assuming you are using the Nvidia Shield, Nexus Player..etc like I do\)*
2.  *Install the Amazon App Store, login using a mouse.*
3.  *Install DTVNow APK and login using your myATT credentials and enjoy it!!!*

While I love that DTV has more channels, the interface is just so far behind that of YouTube TV. I really hope the engineers look at the smart things YouTube TV is doing to improve the watching experience or they will be left behind as these alternatives to cable TV continue to grow in popularity.

* When watching live TV, swiping down on Apple TV remote brings up a list of the last three channels you watched. Makes jumping back and forth a breeze.
* The ability to customize the channel lineup is killer. Not just adding/removing favorites, but actually organizing the order in the list they appear.
* The load time when jumping in between YouTube TV channels is really about 5x faster than DirecTV.
* The Live TV guide lets you see live previews of the channel in progress, not just the name of the network

26,2018-12-16 14:11:40,,"After all this time, they still haven't fixed channels randomly dropping off the favorites list.","Ever since DirecTV Now first came out, one annoying issue I have had is that channels that I have selected as favorites become ""de-selected"".

Once every couple of weeks, I will switch the guide over to All and go through the channels. And sure enough, I always find anywhere from 2 to 4 channels that dropped off the favorites list.

It's always different, so it isn't due to a specific channel.

My hunch is that their system can't handle having a large number of favorites being used and it starts misreading them.

The way I use favorites is that I select every channel I could ever want to watch...not just my ""favorites"". This way I can permanently avoid a lot of the junk channels that I hate.

Has anyone else had this issue, or do most people only select 5 or 6 favorites?

24,2018-08-22 01:16:06,Alwayscur1ous,PSA: Roku guide can be instantaneous,"If you learn the quirks you can get your guide to load instantly AFTER the initial pull. 

So there seems to be quirks in how they decide whether to pull the guide from memory or refresh it. The first time you pull up the guide it takes a while to cache it to memory. This will also happen the first time you select favorites as a filter. 

The key to keeping it from reloading in it's entirety and pulling from memory is to always select an item once the guide is pulled up (even if it is the same channel you are currently watching). You can never pull up the guide and select back. Once you do that it refreshes the guide from scratch. 

Sometimes I notice the guide gets stuck when you pull it up (it won't let you scroll through it). You can't cancel out or it will refresh it next time and take forever to load. To get it unstuck simply select left while in the guide and go back to the right and it will allow up and down scrolling.

21,2018-12-18 14:42:42,mrdctaylor,I've been a Dish customer for ~18 years...Just started my 7 day trial of DTVNOW,"For me, the primary motivation is price. I've been a continuous Dish Network customer since 2000 or so and the prices just keep climbing.   The fights they have with the different broadcasters are irritating too.  We've been without HBO for over a month now.  Before they dropped HBO I was paying almost $150.  I'm still paying $135 for 3 old DVRs with the Top 120 package.  With the kids out of the house--and in college--it has been time for a change.  I don't think any of the services are 100% ready or prime time, but I'm willing to trade off for the cost savings at this point in my life.  


I've kept a spreadsheet comparing all of the streaming providers and their channels.  DTVNOW and PS VUE were the frontrunners.  I know VUE is supposed to be a better experience, but I'm concerned about their longevity.  Plus they don't carry my local Fox affiliate which I cannot get on an antenna.  So for now, DTVNOW is it.  I've been playing around with it for a day on my Roku Ultra and Roku Stick and I've got to say it is better than I expected.  Granted, I know there will be outages.  But I was prepared for it to be pretty bad.  But so far, so good.  The DVR is wonky.  And it is weird how the Roku App always starts playing A&E (first alphabetically, I guess), but it is usable.  And at a monthly savings of around $100 I can live with some bugginess for now.  The nice thing here is that I get sick of it I can cancel and switch services much easier than I could with Satellite!  That's another thing that is very attractive to me.  


I've lurked on this subreddit for a couple of months in anticipation of this.  Now I've taken the plunge--or at least a 7 day free plunge.  We will see how it goes, but I think I can make it work for $100 less per month.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/a7bmkw/ive_been_a_dish_customer_for_18_yearsjust_started/,positive,0.9858

Meanwhile, they are getting ready for their main service, which will be a higher price but have a few more features (like an actual dvr that works with storage included).
They introduce the new service and start shutting down DirectvNOW by cutting channels and raising cost until enough people leave or switch that they can shut the service down all together, leaving the original people who took a chance on it in the cold.
I honestly hope I’m wrong, I like the service.  But I’m also glad I have an outdoor antenna and an old TiVo I dragged out of mothballs to record OTA content.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/aezxti/is_the_whole_thing_just_a_beta_test/,positive,0.9776
19,2018-12-12 15:53:51,exner,This is why a person would want the dtvnow box in beta,"I just got directvnow and I have it setup on a roku and so far Ive been very impressed with picture quality, its actually much better than what I have on cable tv.  
   
What Im not impressed with is how annoying it is to change channels.  In my old cable setup if I wanted to change channels from cbs to nbc I would just click a 2 to 4 digit channel number into my remote.  In this new setup to do the same thing I have to click up to go into the guide which pauses my screen completely and then click the up or down arrow literally like more than 60 times (theres no page up/down that im aware of)
   
Ideally somethings like channel number support and page up/down functionality on the guide would help with that.  Although, I dont know how they would implement that on certain platforms like that dont have number pads.
   
I do realize that there are other options like using the favorites (which I currently have like 40+ channels in) or searching but those still require much more clicking than being able to input a 2-3 digit number.
   
Disclaimer: I think rental fees are stupid, Id rather own my own hardware.  I dont actually have the beta box because I missed the signup by a day, Its just the only option I’ve heard of that has channel numbers.  I cant be the only person to really wish there was a way to get channel numbers in order to navigate easier.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/a5jcbp/this_is_why_a_person_would_want_the_dtvnow_box_in/,positive,0.9435

21,2019-04-30 06:43:29,Fftpallday,There IS hope to get your old grandfathered plan back!!!,"TLDR version:

Recently went on a saving money kick, trying to lower ALL BILLS. (Internet, wireless, XM radio($6 month) etc)

Searched email for DTVN emails from when I canceled service 7/18. 

Noticed it says “You can always restart your account with the same package or switch it up and try something new.”

10 months later, kids bitchin about wanting to watch Disney stuff. 

Initial convo on 4/18/19 got it added back, the go big package. And was told I’d get the grandfathered price of $40. 

Follow up convo on 4/28/19 agent #1 from 4/18 didn’t add on the discount. This agent #2 got it all set up. And price right where I wanted it, no temporary discounts, nada. Even though #2 brought up the increase on 4/12/19, I simply referenced the chat log from agent #1, promises, and the date, being after 4/12/19 $10 price hike. 



It is possible to get it back. Just be polite AF. I was a early adopter and signed up the second day it was available. Try and build rapport. It goes a long ways, be personable too. Normally this is quite the opposite of how I am, I’m a driller on a oil rig and I’m a prick. 


Also worth noting, I still have hbo showing up as part of having ATT for no extra cost, no I’m not on the unlimited and more premium. I forget how I got it for free(signed up for att wireless in 10/18). Best part of all of this is simply: 2 iPhone XR, unlimited data, nighthawk workaround, and DTVN/HBO/GoBig all for ~$202/Month. Can’t wait for next month when I pay off the non free XR and it drops even more!",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/bj0745/there_is_hope_to_get_your_old_grandfathered_plan/,positive,0.7261

20,2019-03-12 05:34:09,echoplex21,"Decided to try out YouTube TV after the rumored price increases, now planning on keeping it whether they increase or not. Mini review below.","-	Stream quality is similar to DTVN when it’s at its best, but a LOT more stable. My headaches of seeing DTV blurry and buffering is finally gone and was shocked to see how reliable it was on YTTV.
-	The UI is a lot better than DTV, a LOT faster than DTV. Also being able to reorder the guide is great. Never have to try to flip through a bunch of channels to get back to where I was and having all your previously watched always there is great.  
-	Having an extra streaming screen is great included. Never have to worry about being blocked from watching live TV in the house.
-	Pause/Rewind works perfectly and actually works with Siri on Apple TV and on My Android TV/Chromecast. Completely forgot how it feels like to do that again after the past few years with DTV.
-	DVR works great - not much more to say. 
-	Family sharing and profiles is great for your own DVR and Channel lists. Only problem is if you’re logged in on a TV client, I don’t see ways to change profiles without signing in and out.
-	I only have Live TV for the news and live sports. All the channels I need (besides BeIN) is here on YTTV, not sure what channels are missing on YT that is on DTV but it’s a non issue for me. 
-	Now that DTV is $50, the $5 HBO isn’t much a selling point anymore. Both services with HBO are now the same.

Overall YTTV is just a lot better than DTVNOW in every way. I wasn’t expecting to like it so much in the free trial and am planning to cancel DTV before the month is over. Honestly not trying to add to the angry mob on the service , but I honestly can’t believe now how long I’ve been supporting this beta test of a service.

After the latest round of price increases, I started looking elsewhere and here's what I found.","I've been using the FuboTV service for a few days now, and it's been a better experience in literally every way, and costs much less than DirecTV NOW does. Here's what I found using an AppleTV 4K:

**PRICE:**

It's a lot cheaper if you need regional sports (MLB for me). It has the big local channels. 

Add-on packages are generally cheaper too. 

**AUDIO/VIDEO QUALITY:**

Channels have 5.1 surround sound. DirecTV NOW had mid-quality stereo and that was frustrating. 

Image quality is all-around better for all channels. 

4K HDR TV is included in the cheapest plan! It's mostly sports and not many games, but still cool to see.  

**USABILITY:**  

Much faster loading, logical, and useful applications on iOS and AppleTV. 

You can just select shows like you would on the AppleTV ""TV"" app and you won't get dead end screens like you often did on DirecTV Now. 

DVR is better too! For sports at least, you can watch the entirety of games that have already aired even if you forgot to record them. 

You can use FuboTV on all devices that DirecTV NOW works on, including through your web browser. 

**CONCLUSION:**

I can't believe I didn't know this service existed. I had fun, DirecTV NOW, but it just wasn't meant to be. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/b6e4zc/ive_been_using_directv_now_since_it_came_out/,positive,0.9831

This has actually happened to me before, when I first signed up for HBO GO. I assumed it would be fixed by itself this time. After 5 days I gave up and contacted DirecTV Now support.

According to tech support, the problem has been fixed internally but, like the last time I had this issue, \_something\_ has to be changed in your DirecTV Now account to trigger the update or refresh on your account so that the changes will make it through the system.

Part of the problem for me is that I signed up for DirecTV Now with my email address as my user id, which causes issues due to it being an email and/or the same email I use for my at&t account.  So support always tries to get me to change my user id to something really awesome like ""sirshannon123"" but I decline. The fix is as simple: Changing my password. The change apparently causes the account changes to propagate and everything works again.

&#x200B;

**What I don't know:** I don't know if I could have fixed the issue by changing my password (via forgot password link) without contacting support.  I guess I'll try that next time.

Anyway, try changing your DirecTV password (not your at&t password \[single sign-in form but no single sign-in, awesome\]) at [directvnow.com](https://directvnow.com) and if that doesn't fix the issue, it's gonna hurt but contact DirecTV Now customer support (I used the chat box on their site) and they'll be able to fix it for you.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/a68gid/how_i_fixed_my_hbo_go_directv_now_problem/,positive,0.9392

It records in the industry standard "".TS"" format. That's easy to convert to MP4 for better compression.

I can get gigabit ethernet alone from them for 80.00/mo.

A maxed out DTVNow package is coming to around 105/mo with 3 screens. 

We do not use the land line for anything, really.

The total bill will be around 200.00/mo with the benefit of not needing anything but an AppleTV or other streaming device on each screen - which we already have.

I believe we get the added benefit of being able to view when on the road.

What am I missing? Is DTVN reliable enough to move to as the primary TV package?

One last q - does DTVN have the NFL RedZone channel?

13,2018-12-12 03:01:05,smoelheim,"Achieving the Impossible: I spoke to a DirecTVNow rep. (Also, getting more information on Buffalo Sabres games on MSG)","This is going to be really long. Apologies in advance.

TL;DR - Called DTVN with my monthly complaint that they aren't broadcasting Buffalo Sabres games on MSG in Western NY. Got a promise that someone would call me back within 30 minutes. THEY DID. Explained the programming problem with MSG. Maybe we'll get some action now. (Maybe not.)

\----------------

First, a little background. Ever since DTVN started carrying MSG Network, they have had the wrong programming here in Western NY. We are supposed to get all of the Buffalo Sabres games, while Islanders/Devils/Rangers games are (I believe) supposed to be blacked out. Instead, we get zero Sabres games, and sometimes we get the other teams, sometimes we don't. I've contacted both DTVN and MSG about this in the past. DTVN gives a different answer every time. MSG claims that they have talked to DTVN about it, and the problem is on the DTVN side. Nothing they can do.

Fast forward to tonight.

I start my monthly-ish chat session with DTVN support. As normal, I start out playing stupid about not getting the games broadcast. Then they start the whole troubleshooting thing. Then I explain how its a problem with all of my devices, and how its a problem for all DTVN subscribers in Western NY. We eventually get to ""Its a known problem, we are working on it"". But instead of letting it go, I decide to push the guy a little bit. Firm, without being rude or threatening.

I ask him ""Whats your favorite team, Mike?"" (Yeah, ""Mike"".. haha). He tells me the Chicago Bears. I dunno. Maybe they show Bears games in India. So I say, ""Mike, would you keep subscribing to a service that promises to show Chicago Bears games every week, but can't deliver on that promise?"" and he says he gets what I am saying, and that he will escalate to his supervisor. I've heard that one before.. about 1/2 of my conversations are supposedly escalated. So I ask him ""Is there any way that I can follow up in a week or two to see where this stands?"", and he says he will have his supervisor call me, within 15-30 minutes. I chuckle to myself, because I've heard this one before too... just once... and of course, nobody ever called me that time. Before I disconnect with Mike, I say, ""Mike, I hope you aren't lieing to me about all of this"". He assures me that someone will call me back.

Well, damn if I didn't get a call back about a half hour later from ""Shawn"" at DirecTV Now (and yes, he also sounded more Indian than Irish... but he was pretty easy to talk to. My first reaction was that ""Mike"" probably had the guy sitting next to him call me and pretend to be his supervisor... but this guy seemed genuinely interested in helping. He let me explain the problem, and asked a few basic questions. I'm not sure that he understood the problem 100%, but he got the general gist of it. He was blaming MSG, but assured me that he would escalate it with the engineering staff at DTVN, and try to get them to work with the right folks at MSG to try and get the problem resolved.  The conversation ended with me thanking him greatly for calling me back and trying to understand and resolve the problem.

I'm still shocked that I was able to talk to someone at DTVN. My jaw hit the floor when the phone rang. I think I have achieved the impossible. Will they fix the problem now? I have no idea. But at least I talked to someone who attempted to understand what was happening, and who (theoretically) has the power to ""really"" escalate and maybe get the right people involved.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/a5e39u/achieving_the_impossible_i_spoke_to_a_directvnow/,positive,0.7709

I use a small tv on my desk while working and I find the in-menu previews make it almost impossible to continually read things as I scroll through... it's like the jump caused by this huge preview in the middle keeps popping up, ruin my ability to track the words as they scroll, and basically forces me to pause at each entry when previously I could scan the shows while they scrolled.  


for me it made it such a hard process that I just now go to the apps in apple tv for each channel, or the main ""tv"" app, and just see all the shows that way instead.

&#x200B;

It happened so subtly that I didn't quite realize it until I went back into the app today for the first time in over a month and realized how jarring it felt to me trying to scroll through the guide with the preview continually causing the words to jump.

- How is the DVR capability? Is it possible to record your shows?

- I heard a lot of cons but I haven’t heard positive things other than it has more channels compared to the other streaming services.

- Do they have hidden fees or increase at some point? I hope not.

* Rebooting the cable modem
* Rebooting the router
* Rebooting the Fire TV
* Clearing the data on the DTVN app
* Uninstalling and reinstalling the DTVN app
* Switching the Fire TV to the 2.8 GHz WiFi access point instead of the 5 GHz access point I usually used
* Switching the Fire TV to my mobile phone's WiFi tethering

9,2018-05-24 16:26:54,rick607,Cord cutting and expectations,"Two months ago I had had enough of the cable company rate increases, poor picture quality and bundle BS. I decided to try streaming instead. 

My first trial was Sling Orange and Blue and it was not for me. I didn't care for the interface or the channel selection. I tried it basically just to see if I would like it. I had the same feeling about Playstation Vue as well. For me, it was just meh...

My next trial was Directv Now. I liked the interface because it resembled what I was used to in cable tv. No DVR was a drawback and virtually no frills had me wanting more.

Having not yet tried Hulu Live, I gave that a shot. My first impression was great, it was the only service that gave me locals, the interface was flashy and felt like it could be a cool new way of watching tv, That didn't last long... picture quality was lacking and the hassle of trying to watch tv ""the old way"" was annoying due to the way they implement live and on-demand content. Also, the fact that I had to supplement it with Philo was too convoluted. I should also add that my wife was not into this switch to streaming nearly as much as me and ""I hate this"" was becoming her mantra.

With nothing left to try since Youtubetv is not in my area yet, I went back to Directv now. It offers the most comprehensive channel selection (for me) and a basic and easy to use guide. Is it perfect? No, not even close, but the picture quality is there along with the content I want, and impending DVR, so I figured it was my best bet.

That is a recap of my experience so far, which brings me to my point in posting this. **Anyone looking to cut the cord and stream has many choices and I often see people asking which is the best service. There is no accurate to answer that question because there is no level playing field.** If you want cheap go with Sling. If you are after channel selection, I say Directv now. I thought Playstion Vue fell somewhere in the middle. Hulu has potential especially if you watch a lot of on-demand network shows. If you're looking to make the switch to streaming be sure to take advantage of every service that offers a free trial and decide for yourself before you cancel your cable service. There is a learning curve and with streaming services, and they don't offer same experience you are used to with cable, so be ready to experiment.

9,2018-05-20 16:33:48,AvailableClassic,How has DVR changed your outlook on DTVN?,"DVR has been out for a week so curious to hear if it’s changed anyone’s view of DTVN, either for the better or worse.  I’ve been in the beta so not much surprises me.  The DVR is pretty solid, albeit with few bells and whistles.  I’m disappointed that several obvious bugs still exist.  Series recordings still don’t work for some shows and I’m dumbfounded that they didn’t provide a way to lock-in the “favorites” listing on the program guide.  Oh, and I have to log into DTVN on one of my devices almost every day.  REALLY annoying.  

DTVN still has zero of my local stations.  Even if they add 1 or 2, all 4 seems very unlikely.  

Right now I’m paying $35 for DTVN $8 per month for the Channels DVR to record local stations.  Should I decide to add the third stream ($5) and extra DVR space ($10), that takes me up to $58.  

Honestly I’m considering switching to Youtube + Philo.  That would be $56 total for 3 streams (really more if some are watching YTTV and others Philo), unlimited DVR and all 4 of my local stations.  The YTTV interface is superior.  The individual user accounts are a very nice feature for a family of 4.  YTTV has Xbox One support (we own two consoles.)  The only real negative I see is the commercial situation on YTTV DVR.  But I actually find myself not fast-forwarding about half the time on these cloud DVRs because it’s just so clunky.  

This wasn’t meant to be a “bye-bye, I’m leaving” post.  Still not sure what I’ll do.  Just curious to hear where others stand after a few days with the long-awaited DVR and new interface.

I just hooked up my non-tech-savvy mother with DirecTVNow using a Firestick 4K and she's not loving it.

She's having trouble figuring out how to easily use the DVR to be sure her shows are recorded. And the guide and show selection interfaces are less than intuitive for her (she's in her mid-70s).

I'm hoping Apple TV or Roku will provide a more user-friendly GUI and experience.

When I watch a DVR'd show, I used to be able to tap the right of the remote to FF 15 sec. Now when I do that now it either just stops the show or makes it jump like 10 minutes.

The only way I can FF or Rewind is by pausing and ball parking it by moving the curser forward or back without actually seeing where I'm at. 

This is new - It didn't react this way even yesterday. Very frustrating. I checked my remote in Netflix and the clicking works for the 10 sec FF and Rewind.

I'm hesitant to complain, because it's just about watching TV...but I'm about 4 months into having DirecTVNow on my Roku Ultra.  When I start the app on Roku, the guide comes up with ALL available channels in alphabetical order.  Not my favorites, and not the last channel I was watching.  When I'm watching something and bring up the guide, it comes up NOT on the channel I'm watching, but with the first channel in alphabetical order.  I spend a lot of time scrolling and clicking.

I do have an SD card in my Roku.  Not sure 'why', since it doesn't appear to store anything.

I wish I had more control over my defaults, and that Roku would remember my settings.  It does remember which channels are favorites, but I have to ask for my Favorites List every time I turn it on.

I know these are little complaints, because the channels all look and sound great and I finally have the DVR figured out.  But the issues with the guide make me a little nuts.

7,2018-10-04 20:10:33,eXistenceLies,Week 1 of DTVN....,"Things I have noticed with streaming this service on Roku/Amazon/Android....

&#x200B;

**CONS...**

DVR's playback sound is noticeably quieter than live TV.

Watching recorded shows/movies it freezes quite often at like half second intervals. I want to say it happens on live TV too.

Watching recorded shows/movies it will sometimes starts to buffer then starts back from beginning of show.

No way to change the 15 second skip forward. Should be an option that I hope to come soon.

Noticeably slower on Roku device.

Interface def needs a buff to make things snappy. If they could make it as snappy as ROKU's interface it would be fantastic. Amazon's interface is kinda clunky. Never used Apple TV nor no plans to.

DVR is in Beta mode (not really a con per-say, but for some people this will turn them off). It'll improve a lot by next year I bet.

&#x200B;

**PROS...**

Cheap monthly bill compare to Comcast (previous cable provider).

Don't have to use their internet service to use their streaming service like Comcast.

Can change your subscriptions monthly. Perfect for when you only want to watch one show per year that comes out on HBO/Showtime/etc. Of course there are other ways to view those show for free, but I won't mention that.

3 streams as of now isn't bad, but would like to see more in the future.

Same goes with more DVR space.

Not sure how many recordings you can record at once, but coming from Comcast it was 5 shows. (Someone correct me here).

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I think that is it for now. The cons aren't going to scare me away either. I have all the channels I need and I am not paying $100+ for HD TV plus $30 in DVR boxes + HD boxes. Good thing is my internet provider (Entouch) does not have a data cap on their fiber package. Now I can stream as much as I want in the best quality. Just wanted to share my experiences after 1 week.

7,2018-08-03 21:18:11,robertpetry,I'm struggling to figure out how to watch local NFL on CBS,"Hello all. Hopefully you will have a solution for me.  

I currently have the promo ""go big"" plan that is only $40 per month and is no longer offered.  This is great as I have a bunch of channels and the best streaming package per buck in the market.  I don't want to give it up.  

But I need to be able to watch my local CBS (Indy) to see Colts games each week.  I would like to be able to steam anywhere, play on my TV, pause and rewind, and record for later.  Sounds great BUT my local CBS is not on DirecTVNow.  But it is on Hulu TV and YoutubeTV.  I would have to drop the DTVNow if I picked one of the other two to get my local CBS. 

I have looked at other options:

1. Use antenna - would be fine for live games but no recording (without buying another box and setting that up), no streaming outside of home, no live pauses (without box).  So pretty restrictive.
2. I could use my local CBS app that has view live TV - but the quality is total crap.  Streaming it to the TV with Airplay is horrible.  It just does not work well enough for me. 
3. Subscribe to CBS All Access - but live NFL games are excluded from the subscription
4. Subscribe to NFL Sunday Ticket, but local games are excluded live - only out of market are live.  

So I guess I am at a crossroads.  Give up DTVNow and my great package/promo price or miss football each week.

Original post: OWN (Oprah Winfrey Network) app login with your DirecTV Now login. You'll have to choose ""Manifest Communications"" to log in on your devices -- tested this on both Android and iOS 13 beta 2 and it works. If you're on iOS, single sign-on may work.

Hopefully, AT&T will allow DTVN users to log in to Warner properties, like CNN, TBS, and TNT, in the future.

Update: It looks like OWN removed the ability to log in with Manifest. I tried last night on my iPhone and Fire Stick 4K and it worked. This morning I tried on my ATV and Manifest was not an option.

&#x200B;

1. Are there any issues to watch out for, or workarounds I need to be aware of?
2. When fast forwarding through recorded shows, the commercials on the satellite version shows progress but the DTV Now version shows a static image with the time progressing?
3. I'm using the FireTV Cube which seems fast and smooth, but looks like it has more functionality with the satellite hardware than the DTV Now app. For example, if I tell it to switch to Comedy Central instead of changing channels on DTV Now it switches inputs to satellite and goes to that channel.
4. On my Epson 3700 projector with a 106"" screen the picture on DTV Now seems as good as satellite with the hour or two I watched last night. I haven't tried it on my 4K Samsung TV.
5. My wife commented that the surround speakers next to the couch weren't working. Later they seemed to be working. Is this channel related, or was it a setting I changed messing around?

I want to say if I had to complete a command on scrolling through the options and searching for a movie the Roku would win by at least 5 seconds. Amazon FireTV is laggy most of the time. Maybe it is because of the Logitech Harmony remote I use, but I use this remote for both Roku and FireTV. The only thing I dislike Roku is when I click on guide it stops the background show/movie from playing. On FireTV it continues to play in background and becomes transparent.

&#x200B;

**Notes**:

* I currently pay $25 for the $40 ""Live a Little"" package because of the AT&T discount. I usually bump this up to the ""Just Right"" package in the fall to get more sports networks and then I pay $35 for the $50 package.
* If the increase is $10 I would be paying $35 and $45 during the year which is pretty comparable to YTTV at $40 and YTTV already includes the sports channels (ESPNU, SEC Network, etc.) that I have to upgrade my DTVN package to get every fall. How comparable they are overall really depends on which channels you watch.
* I only get Fox as a local channel on DTVN. I get ALL locals including The CW on YTTV.
* I get HBO for free because of AT&T.

I recently signed up for DTVN and I am running an Asus Zenpad 3s 10 and it has Android 7.0 - I am experiencing issues where live TV is crystal clear but everything else like on demand is very blurry and fragmented. I have 300mbps internet and it is the sole item using the WIFI. 

I sometimes have this with Netflix or WWE Network but after a few seconds it becomes crystal clear. However, I have let it play for upwards of 30 minutes and it is still in terrible quality. Even items such as HBO are showing in this terrible quality. 

Has this been an ongoing issue?

6,2019-02-20 01:08:01,Whiplash104,Dolby Digital on RSN (NBC Sports Net),"Hi folks.  I haven't tried DTVN in a while and fired it up on Roku last night.  I noticed that most channels are now Dolby Digital, so I got really excited as it was one of several factors holding me back from switching from DTV satellite.

&#x200B;

Reading [Cord Cutter News's](https://www.cordcuttersnews.com/directv-now-expands-5-1-audio-to-more-channels/) coverage, the article says "" According to reports DIRECTV NOW now offers 5.1 audio on all channels that support Dolby Digital Audio or DTS"" and "" Only programs that are recorded in Dolby Digital Audio will offer Dolby Digital Audio.""

I noticed that NBC Sports Net (and the RSNs) were stereo.  Fair enough as Hockey isn't surround sound.  However, on satellite, the channel outputs DD to my receiver.   So my question is, does DirecTV satellite upmix stereo to DD 5.1 for output on that channel?    I wouldn't have any way of knowing.  Does this mean that content like this that is inherently stereo will come through the stereo?  Or is the audio broadcast in 5.1 and DTV Now is only supporting stereo on those channels?

This isn't a complaint or anything.  I'd rather the audio be delivered natively anyway.  If it's recorded in stereo, I'd rather it be delivered in stereo and vice versa.  I was just wondering if anyone had a more technical explanation of what content is DD, which is not, and why.

I was legitimately excited to see live streams come through in DD, LOL. When my promo with DTV Satellite is up I might try to make the switch (again.)  I tried last year but DVR wasn't there, streams were failing a lot, and I got a win back deal that was pretty insane.

4,2019-02-04 21:07:10,alfasf,Directv now data cap on Roku," 

Hello community, 

After research in different forums, I still have failed to find an alternative solution to my bandwidth situation as we are on data cap (1TB) from Xfinity. We have changed our viewing habits to watching TV on one tv if necessary for example. We became cord cutters meaning we cut tv service so we rely on broadband Internet.

Right into our decision of cutting the cord we signed up for Sling for a month, we found our data usage went up reasonably because of the streaming after adjusting the video quality on Sling, so pretty much we were averaging 1 - 1.5 Gb per hour (15-20 GB per day). However, we didn’t like Sling and subscribed to Directv Now, and our data consumption increase dramatically in just two days since we signed up (7GB - 10 GB per hour; 50-75GB per day!) so as you all may see we would exceed the data in less than 20 days!

This is our home setting:

ISP: Xfinity 

Plan: 60Mbps

Cable Modem: Technicolor CGM4140COM 

Streaming Devices: 2 Roku Premiere Plus

TV types: 2 1080p TVs

Location: SF Bay Area 

This is what I have tried so far:

1. Adjust Rokus to 720p from the Roku display menu. This is the lowest display type offered. I would like set it to lower for SD viewing
2. Adjustable override bit rate from secret menu: 5 Home, 3 back, 2 forward set to 0.3 Mbps. Looks like this doesn’t do much effect to Directv Now     
3. Directv Now support were not able to configure the bandwidth on my account. 
4. Purchased a Netgear AC1600: I had read in different forums and tech sites that a router would give me more control on set limits to streaming so it doesn’t consume so much data by using QoS features. However, I was disappointed to find out their QoS is not very friendly on how to use the feature. Calling Netgear tech support and their forums are empty on how to use this feature. 
5. Make sure closing the Roku app and set to Home before turning TV off. 
6. Wifi password is secured and not one else using it.
7. We also have Antenna TV but reception gets bad in bad weathers.
8. Besides of relying on streaming for entertainment, our household is very simple for Internet. One PC connected to Ethernet, 1 Ipad disable for apps to auto-update, 2 windows PC that manually updates. All of them do basic browsing, occasional music streaming (Pandora, Spotify, etc..), YouTube on browser or app. NO GAMING in household.   

Basically if someone recommends a good router that is pretty straightforward to set the two Rokus to certain downstream, and that  it shows the data consumption per device. I would like to set the streaming to a reasonably data streaming (1GB per hour or less).  

Anyone of you have suggestion on how to deal with this. Feel free to ask anything that may be useful useful or consider.

Hopefully this thread become a reference for those who are in a similar situation like me.

At first I was worried that 20 hours would not be enough but it looks like most of the shows I watch are on-demand so if I missed a show I forgot to record I can still watch it on demand. So If you can watch any show on demand after its original air date then why would you even need DVR unless this doesn't hold true for some shows and I just haven't noticed yet.

It seems DTV Now could just keep all previously aired shows and link to them in the app, that way there is only one copy of a show which would save server space. Are they really setting aside 20 hours for every customer and having multiple copies of the same show spread out across those accounts?

I don't have STARZ currently, but plan to subscribe when American Gods comes back in a few months.  My wife wants to catch up on Outlander too.  Anyway, it looks like we can add Starz to DTVN for $8/month or  subscribe directly and use the Starz app for $8.99.  We could also add it to our Amazon Prime for $8.99 as well.  


I'm looking for opinions on the best way.  Doing it via DTVN saves a buck and gives me a few (how many?) live channels.  I'm on the lowest tier, so I think I might get 3 channels if I add Starz.  It looks like I cannot sign in to the STARZ app with DTVN credentials, so we are limited to using the DTVN app to watch content. How is this?  Does it work fine?  Any downside?  Do new episodes of things like American Gods hit on-demand on DTVN as soon as they do on the STARZ app?  


Doing it directly via STARZ means I have to give them my credit card.  I'm not sure if cancelling will be a hassle.  It costs 99 cents more and I do not think it has the live channels.  Any reason to go this route?  I know they are running a $5/mo for 3 months promo right now, but I don't really plan to subscribe until March.

I either have to select to record the series (new episodes only), then manually go in and delete every single rerun, or I’d have to manually record each individual new episode.  Neither of those is ideal, especially if you forget to do the setup in advance for a week.

When will this be fixed?  It’s been months now.

3,2018-08-31 15:35:06,GMahler_vrroom,Question about the Cloud DVR recordings...,"I've had DTVNow service for a little while (signed up to get the ""free"" ATV4K), but only just started messing with the Cloud DVR.  The very first recording I scheduled (the season finale of ""Preacher"" on AMC) turned out to be unwatchable - the recording had numerous skips/gaps embedded into it, resulting in sections of dialogue and action just missing entirely.  It didn't matter when I watched (I came back and tried it again multiple times), so I don't think it was a streaming issue.  Also, the gaps were exactly at the same moment in the recording every time.  (Thankfully I also recorded it on my TiVo that I haven't quite abandoned yet.)

So here's what I'm wondering: was that 'my' recording of ""Preacher""?  As in, a personal recording of the episode into the cloud that was made just for my account?  Or was that recording made by DTV from the live broadcast by AMC and then shared to multiple users (anyone else who also requested to record ""Preacher"") - and therefore lots of people were experiencing the same issues?

I'm wondering about this for two reasons: 1) does it do any good to ""re-record"" a badly recorded show - because if we all get the same 'shared' episode from the cloud, that bad recording would potentially just be waiting yet again; 2) if we are getting shared recordings, this might play into why they are not responding to requests for user-specific changes like episode padding (more time at the start or end of an episode), as what we see as ""our"" recordings are just copies from a shared pool.

Sorry if this has already been discussed to death - just trying to think this through as part of my cord-cutting adventures.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/9bumln/question_about_the_cloud_dvr_recordings/,positive,0.7703

Two days ago I chatted with a rep and asked about NFL RedZone coming to DTVN. He told me after some research and talking to his manager that negotiating for the channel are all but final and that it will be available for this upcoming season. He went as far to make a guarantee for this. 

Sounds a bit like BS, yes, and we’ve heard it before, but if coincides with NFL Network being added recently along with Season Ticket in a few markets.

* Click ""Menu"" to see the menu screen that includes ""Watch Now"", ""My Library"" and ""Discover""
* Navigate to ""Discover""
* Select ""Networks""
* Under ""All Networks"" select a normal channel like ""ABC"" or ""A&E"" (whatever you have available)
* Switch from ""Programs"" to ""On Now""
* You should see an abbreviated version of the guide that shows just this channel.
* Now when you go back to the regular ""Guide"", you should see all channels without a problem.

I have no idea why this worked but it's been a week and it hasn't gone away. I haven't tried restarting my Apple TV or anything to replicate the issue and confirm the solution - hoping I can keep it like this for awhile. ;)

It's possible this is related to the Apple TV update earlier this week (https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/8zma41/apple_tvonly_update_says_log_out_issue_is_fixed/), but I'm pretty sure I ""fixed"" this on my Apple TV prior to that update.

Yesterday I received a Roku update, and last night was able to finally watch shows on DVR again.

I  had some minor buffering within the shows, but overall I was able to get through a 2 hour show in just over an hour (skipping commercials).  After that, a 30 minute show I was able to FF past commercials with no issues.

Hopefully a good sign of things to come.

The other thing is that the 100 hour option is available behind the scenes.  I asked a support person to bump me up to 100 hours (with a credit to offset the cost) as a result of issues.

The cost is $5 a month (I received an automated email after the activation).

I don't know if everyone has this yet, the support person said they saw the option on my profile and was able to activate.

4,2018-09-30 15:02:15,Eisofen,I‘m done!,"Over the last few months I‘ve used DTVN and was happy, most of the time. This changed dramatically last month. I also chatted with the support about my issues.
It started with this football season on ESPN. MNF was unwatchable because the picture just freezes after a few minutes while audio keeps going. Switching channels helps but that error keeps coming back. It also happens on other events like F1.
DVR is very flaky the last few weeks. Recordings have skips in them. I know it‘s still beta but was doing fine before.
Buffering issues: I don’t know how many times per evening I get: „your network seems to be underperforming...“. Example: tried to watch F1 this morning, after two minutes I had that message, video came back blurry. Happened another time two minutes later. Switched to the ESPN app: picture is perfectly sharp, no buffering issues the entire race. This is an ongoing problem on every program.
Support: the espn problem above was reported via chat and a fix was promised within two days, nothing happened. I‘m sick of doing the „reinstall app, reboot every device, check WiFi“ dance, which clearly doesn‘t help at all.
Black screen: often the running program just goes black within the first half our after switching on. Just happens once. Problem from the beginning. According to the changelog it should have been fixed.

While the package itself is a good deal, the app on Apple TV just blows. Sorry but I’m not shelling out money for a service which gets worse over time. Bye DTVN

3,2018-10-22 20:36:19,everydave42,Why I left DTVNow,"Not a rage or brag post, just informative for those that might have had the same issues I've had and what I've found in another round of research...

Equipment (since it can affect experience):

\- Apple TV 4k

\- Comcast ""up to"" 150mb (routinely tests via speediest and fast at 160+ from the ATV)

\- Orbi Mesh networking, ATV hardwired into Sat.

I stuck with DTVNow for 3+ months on their intro offer. I liked their channel line up and discounts on HBO and Showtime. Unfortunately I was never very happy with it because:

\- Picture quality in general was OK but never great. However, any live sports was bad. Lots of pixelation and stutters. I assume this had something to do with their own encoding process of that data as it came in from the event

\- DVR never worked: pausing live tv would last less than a minute, any longer of that and it would jump to live with no option to rewind. Trying to set up recording of shows never worked (always gave some error message)

\- Local channel nonsense: didn't have NBC for a while, as soon as we got that along with promotional email about it, we lost ABC silently

\- User interface is...just weird. Repeated ways to get to guide, but none of it intuitive. I know there's some limitations with how the ATV has the ""simple"" remote, but this is just crack-addled.

\- No Dolby 5.1 sound

\- Price Hike

\- Repeated service and billing issues: When calling in to ask what can be done about the above I would go through reboot and setting hoops, all would fail, would be told I would get credits. Credits wouldn't show up on account have to call back in to get those credits...twice, with one credit STILL not applied (combo of monthly and one time).

After spending too much time on chat and phone chasing credits I just decided it wasn't worth it even though I (supposedly) had outstanding credit on my account, I cancelled it.

I'm now on Hulu Live TV and so far it's the best of what I've tried (I had also tried Sling a bit ago). If you already have a Hulu account it's another $33 a month so a good deal (to me, anyway). It's got a 7 day trial so you can just do that if you want to see. Upsides:

\- Much better picture quality, including live events

\- DVR just works. Live pausing, show recording, etc..all as expected

\- User interface is much more intuitive. Still weird due to ATV remote limitations, but it's much more clear and concise, almost intuitive.

Downsides:

\- No Velocity/Discovery Network channels, but those are supposed to come in December..no idea of those come with a price change or not

\- No HBO/Showtime discount..but with the cheaper core cost of the service it's about a wash

\- No Dolby 5.1 sound.

So there you have it. I know different people have different experiences, based in large part on device they're using. But the perpetual non functional DVR ""beta"" state and the inability of customer support and billing to accomplish much of anything left me dissatisfied. Maybe HuluTV will turn out to be a bust as well, but so far it's promising, maybe I'll stick with them a bit..or maybe something like this will be posted in their sub in a few months...

Are there any pointers to make it easier for her? Any regrets from those that have done the same? She mainly watches FoxNews and HGTV, so it doesn't make sense for her to pay $90/mo like she is now.

2,2019-03-14 06:33:00,lexguru86,It isn't that bad. I'm just concerned about how long it will last.,"Even at DTVN's largest package, the fact that there are no box fees and no contracts is still a win for me. The recent survey shows that most people plan on keeping DTVN even with the price hikes.

&#x200B;

Let's look at the new prices:

&#x200B;

Live a Little ($50) -> Entertainment ($93)

Just Right ($65) -> Choice ($110)

Go Big ($75) -> Xtra ($124)

Gotta Have It ($85) -> Ultimate ($135)

Todo Y Mas ($55) -> Optimo Mas ($86)

&#x200B;

Live a Little: $43 increase (86%)

Just Right: $45 increase (69%)

Go Big: $49 increase (65%)

Gotta Have It: $50 increase (59%)

Todo Y Mas: $31 increase (56%)

&#x200B;

Thanks to /u/holow29 for the clear breakdown

&#x200B;

Ultimate at $135 with HBO and Showtime + 3 streams puts me at around $166 a month + tax.

&#x200B;

**I have never seen a single cable company that offers these channels at a price this low without a contract.**

&#x200B;

Not to mention the fact that we don't need to rent boxes? I have a TV in my living room, kitchen, garage, office, bedroom, guest bedroom, and even on buildings in my property that are detached from my main home.. If I want to add another one? Cool, I buy a FireTV or ATV and viola, I have cable in that room.

&#x200B;

So yeah, the price increase and new packages come as a shock to us. But the convenience of not having to call support for a new box installation, paying rent for multiple boxes, being able to just drop or downgrade packages without dealing with retention teams, is well worth even the $161 a month. Plus the channel lineup for most packages are pretty decent. Comcast will give me a thousand channels for $79 a month + $40 in fees. 90% of those channels will be music channels.

&#x200B;

I'm just hoping they keep all of the channels. After reading some responses, it actually makes sense to keep these channels as they plan on transitioning people from DTV to DTVN.

Two, Vue increased their price a year ago up by $10 (for locals that I still wouldn't have in my area). Sling TV increased their price by $5 just last month. And YouTube TV increased their price by $5 a few months ago.

It's clear that all of these streaming TV packages are not making enough money, but they needed a low price to get customers. A price increase was inevitable. To be upset at a price increase is reasonable, I understand that. It's actually a big reason I switched from Vue Core to DTVN.

The Osprey box will eventually support a variety of subscription options (Full DTV over IP / DTVN).  Potentially as early as Q4.

The upcoming un-named WarnerMedia Netflix competitor will have some kind of tie in to the DTV ecosystem. 

Things seem to be accelerating since the ATT Warner acquisition was formally approved so expect the rumor mill to heat up soon.

That was 2 weeks ago... as of tonight, I can still watch every channel on my Apple TV 4k and smartphones.    I've also gotten emails from them almost once a week with promo discount codes to get me to restart my service.

So what is going on?   They can't be charging me because I originally paid the 3 months of subscription using a Visa gift card  from a grocery store. It was purchased with cash and obviously my name was not on the card.  The card's balance went to 73 cents after I paid for the DirecTVNow subscription.

Compared to spectrum cable tv, its amazing. The phone app is sublime (seriously, i have no idea how i can stream hd tv (high bitrate hd too) over my lte despite not being able to watch youtube above 480p). I love how if i pause live tv on the phone app (android) when i hit play, it picks up where the show has moved on to and doesn't buffer. the price is great. hbo for 5 bucks? hell yeah. 

But when i downloaded the apps on our smart tv's, the experience wasn't the same. 

I'm not talking about the laggy ui (almost all smart tv's have a laggy ui. Tv's i don't think have much processing power) or the un-intuitive controls. I can handle those because they're no worse than spectrums app. 

The app... every maybe 30 minutes or so, it buffers for like 30 solid seconds. missing live tv. This isn't viable. I can't imagine missing 30 seconds of the latest hit series or something. 

I don't know why it happens. Its not the device because it happened on my roku tv (build in roku) and my fire stick on another tv. The screen will freezer for like 10 seconds, then the blue circle comes up for another 20, then it resumes. 

I don't get it. My internet is insanely fast. 

The phone app works fine. 

That said, the bitrate is phenominal. The hd looks almost 2k on my tv. Very good details etc. But it ""buffers"" if you can call it that. 

I don't know if there's a fix. Can i turn down the bitrate maybe? make it look more like normal hd? 

It isn't my internet, i clocked it at 120mbps this morning. 

If this doesn't get resolved i'm going back to spectrum. i haven't formally cancelled my plan yet. 

Seriously about to lose a very enthusiastic customer.

I have since received a fire stick as a gift and was wondering if the app functions better on the fire stick than the Roku. I plan on doing the free week trial but I'm not sure that'll be enough time to fully catch all the bugs I found with the Roku app. I have Vue now and they are raising the price to $50 for the package I have. $5 isn't a big deal but I figured why not get a possible 20 channel upgrade for the same price.

**My wife and I pay**

\- $70 for AT&T gigabit Fiber internet ($80 but -$10 for bundling)

\- $110 for AT&T cell ($80+$15 per line) for 10gb with rollover (we stay well below 10gb)

\- $12.45 for our iphone 7’s total (we got deal where they paid base iphone payment over 24 months with trade-in of 6 or 6s... wife got 256 gb, i got 128 gb so we pay a 4.12 and 8.33)

\- $35 for DirecTV Now grandfathered Go-Big plan (we are completely on Apple TV 4K’s for TV)

\- $5 for HBO (I don't think we use it enough)

\- $13.99 for 4k Netflix

\- $10 Amazon Prime ($120/12)

\- $8.33 - Nest Camera ($100/12)

\- $7 - iCloud Storage $2.99 x 2

**So we pay approx.** **the following without factoring in the fees/taxes AT&T throws on the phone bill:**

$271.77

**Of course this changes:**

\- once we get charged $5 more of DirecTV Now (which I'm fine with)

\- if we ever upgrade our phones again

After cancelling I figured I would watch what was left on my DTN DVR before my paid month was up.

2,2019-03-15 05:12:22,RobL24,Is DirecTV Now Really That Bad... (from a former Dish Network Subscriber)?,"I just became a Directv Now subscriber as of late February 2019. Dish Network didn’t have HBO, and I was getting concerned about GoT. Additionally, with HBO, my Dish Network bill was $132! I looked into cutting the cord in 2018, but Directv Now didn’t have a DVR back then, and the other services didn’t have all the channels I required (Nick Jr, MTV, VH-1, HGTV, and OWN... the wife watches OWN).

Since Directv Now had everything I needed, I did the 7-day trial. I was impressed! I have AppleTV 4K so I had excellent picture quality and 5.1 sound. I was saving $72/month, and I had the channels I actually watched versus a whole bunch of stuff I didn’t. Yeah, no RW on Live TV, and RW/FW sucks on on-demand/recorded programs (if even available); also, the guide sometimes gets stuck, and you have to close it, and then re-open it. One last thing, DVR sucks too as only 20 hours, and I am not able to see all the programs that I have it set to record. Otherwise, I thought the look and feel was very sleek (I like the channel surfing feature which no other service has?) in comparison to my Hopper 3. I do miss my Hopper 3’s 500 hour DVR capabilities though. 

I started hearing about the price hike and potential loss of channels so I started looking at other services. I didn’t see anything else that met my family’s needs. Yeah, I could get YouTube TV and Philo, but then I’d have to use two separate apps to see all the channels I want to see. Also, based on my research YouTube TV seemed to have less 1080P/60 FPS and 5.1 sound. Philo seemed to be even less in terms of picture quality (720P/30 FPS) and sound (Stereo) than YouTube TV. 

While I was hoping that I’d get an extra 100 hours with a non-Beta DVR with the $10 price hike, I didn’t. Overall, Directv Now’s superior picture quality, sound, and all-in-one solution works for me. I am still saving $60/month. 

I am hoping for improvements, but after the price hike and after hearing all the broken promises, I doubt we’ll see anything.

I feel like everyone who was extremely upset were on these ridiculously low plans that no way could have been maintained. I switched from Dish... saving $60/month right now is still great for me!

I would fix this by moving some of these channels around. Maybe add CBS sports network to the $40 and $55 plans seeing how there is a demand for the aaf currently.

2. Updated to new Directv Now Fire TV app today and noticed HBO was now missing. 
3. After chat for 50min w 2 reps I ask for a supervisor to call me. A call that lasted another hour.
4. The 1st chat rep has split my account into 2. One for HBO free for life n other for live a little plan. To watch hbo live I have to log into directv now with another login/pass. Could not be fixed.

Turns out my free 12 months of $35 plan was not free at all. I had payed 3 months $35/month off my card with no credits applied. Supervisor then said after 3 billing cycles I will get the 12 months free. I said it’s been 3 billing cycles already n I see where there is a new bill due. He said the 3 months has to start again because my att cell phone verification was mishandled 3months ago, even though the verification went thru for free HBO for life. 

So now he wants me to pay a total of 6 months then get 12 months free. Mind you I’m on Fire TV boxes 2nd gen and DTVN has been unusable until today’s 2.0. Still paid for VUE.

1,2018-08-07 17:58:21,dfnj123,"Switching to AT&T Unlimited and More Premium Plan, trying to figure out options to lower Grandfathered ""Go Big"" w/ HBO","For DirecTV Now I'm currently on a grandfathered discounted ""Go Big"" plan w/ HBO for $45 a month (been sticking it out since day 1!).  Along with others I'm little irked about the price increases, but I'm willing to accept that it's a solid deal for what it is.  For my cell phone I'm on an old styled AT&T FamilyTalk Nation Plan with the grandfather unlimited data, which initially started as a $30 add on, but has slowly crept up to $45 over the past decade.  Currently pay my proportional part of that phone bill which ends up being around $85-ish a month.

I'm tempted to move my cell phone line over to an individual account, and switch to one of AT&T's newer Unlimited data plans to lower month costs.  The newer plans would let me also take advantage of features (like using my phone as a personal hotspot), that I currently do not have access to.  Free HBO and possible DirecTV Now or AT&T Watch discount would be an appreciated plus.

I currently have an indoor TV antenna, so access to regional networks is not an issue.  I also do not watch sports channels, and do not need the digital DVR access (though I'd rather have it than not).  Loss of TV app logins wouldn't be the end of the world either since I could subscribe to a service like Hulu for less than the amount I would save.

These are the three setups I'm considering:

1. AT&amp;T Unlimited and More Premium Plan ($80-ish) + Grandfathered DTVN Go Big ($40) + HBO ($0).  **TOTAL: $120ish**
2. AT&amp;T Unlimited and More Premium ($80-ish) +  DTVN Live a Little ($40) + HBO ($0) - Video Loyalty Credit ($15).  **TOTAL: $105ish**

0,2018-08-02 03:01:14,drewdigg36,Roku slow loading of channels,"I have a new Roku Ultra and just signed up for DTV Now trial. 

Whenever I start a channel, change channels, start a DVR recording or come out of pause it takes forever to load.  I get the ""It's taking longer than expected to load"" message and then the message about something wrong with the network.  Eventually like 40 seconds later the show loads and then it runs great, no buffering, stuttering, etc.  Navigating through the UI and guide seems pretty snappy, it's just loading the actual content.

If I use the DTV Now app on my phone or PC on the same network it loads right away.  I don't have the same issues with other apps on the Roku.  Netflix loads super quick.  I am also doing a Youtube TV Trial and the channels change must faster there.  

Do other people have this problem with the DTV Now Roku app or is there something wrong with setup or Roku or something?

Update: Solved. Turns out it was my router. Replaced my older personal router with a new one from Optimum and it works great now. Channels load much faster.

However, last night I called tech-support to report a problem and they offered me $10 a month off my next 3 bills for the next three months. 

After the support rep added the credit, I received an email that quoted my new discounted rate and further added  “when your promotion ends on (date) your total amount for Live a Little” will be $35.00 + tax.”  

On my payment history it used to say the next bill for August will be for $39 excluding tax. Now it says my next bill for August will be for $25 excluding tax. Time will tell if I get bumped back to the increased rate after my discount expires…

2. Then they increased it by 5.00 dollars
3. Now there going to increase it by 10 dollars?

I’ve chatted with DirectTV NOW chat support way before the price went up n I was told many times that my plan won’t go up what so ever. 

I contacted them when I got the 1st email about the 5 dollars increase, I told them,I was told before that there would not be a price increase for grandfathered customers. I presented the chat transcript to the CSR, and they said there nothing they can do and they offered me a credit on my bill.

Now I get the email saying that my price will increase by $10, I then went back to the chat support and I said I have stuck with you guys since you guys first came out. I was told that my price will never increase because I git early pricing promo. Then the price increase by five dollars I contacted you guys and you guys in disregarded what I was told in regards to my price will never increase. But you guys reassured me that my plan will not be affected, I will only go out this one time for the five dollars so I accepted that.

Then you guys say that my price will increase by $10 that is not right, I feel like you guys are lying to people and thinking it’s OK.  I stuck by you guys every time you guys lie to me about my price would never increase and you guys still lied to me I need to get something for this cause this is a makes no sense.

I chatted with a manager n was told that he will email the higher ups to see what they can do for me n he offered me a 10 dollar credit.

We need to do something about this come together n get them to keep our prices to 35 dollars as promised and not 40, or now 50.00 dollars.

&#x200B;

Bye, satellite. Hello, streaming!

&#x200B;

Well, recently I signed up for directvnow... streaming = good, and their streaming dvr was something I wanted to try out.  So I recorded the first episode of American Horror Story: Apocalypse.

There's a scene -- very mild spoiler here -- where the characters are walking around in some fine mist / fog.  And the compression was as bas as I've ever seen it.  You could count the gray blocks of mist, all over the screen.  Truly awful artifacting / banding.

&#x200B;

Is this ... normal for directvnow?  Is it because it was on their DVR, and not a live feed? Or is this what I can expect from their service, because they haven't learned shit from their satellite feeds?

EDIT:  No idea why it won't accept my PayPal. I was using the same Visa debit card that the DTVN site accepted under the credit card section, and can confirm that it works.

I was seeing the $1 on my bank statement from PayPal, but DTVN would not process the change. I decided to test it with my Visa debit just in the credit section and add HBO to my plan. It charged me immediately a prorated amount of $1.50 for the rest of my billing cycle and the charge went through and shows on my bank statement.

0,2018-05-20 10:26:09,-DB-Cooper,DTV Now Questions,"I’m sure this is covered in a variety of posts, but there’s some ambiguous content on DirecTVs page and so many new features that I wanted to ask actual users some questions. I’m also considering YTTV. 

Background: I currently have DirecTV via satellite. I have an on-premise DVR (Genie), one wired receiver and one wireless receiver. We are HEAVY DVR users. Outside of sports and Formula1, we don’t watch live TV. We have a toddler who watches variously Disney things, VOD should work for him. My wife watches tons of sitcoms and dramas on network TV and a few on non-premium subscription channels (HGTV, etc). Anyways, we are moving across town and it’s a good time to consider modernizing. We have tons of Apple devices everywhere. Finally, DirecTV left a hole in my roof at my last home which ended up leaking, so I’m less interested in putting a dish up at the new place. 

Questions are:
- Is local TV (abc, fox, cbs, etc) available in Austin, TX? Their web site doesn’t let me check locals specifically. 

- 20 hours of DVR isn’t going to cut it for us. I understand a 100 hour package is coming for a small premium, when is that available?

- I read that many shows are available on VOD. Questions is: How soon would a network show be on VOD? For example, how soon after Modern Family airs would that episode be on VOD (circumventing the need for DVR)?

- Are shows on VOD impossible to fast forward, rewind, skip? Commercials are a total show stopper. 

- Are DVR shows converted to VOD automatically when available? This is both good and bad. Obviously it would help tremendously with DVR usage, but it may also prevent FF/REW and Skip controls. 

My major concern with YTTV is the reports that DVR shows are converted to VOD quickly and people can’t skip commercials. Wondering how this works in DTVNow? Also, I’m currently an ATT mobile customer and am enjoying large discounts for having video through ATT, so there’s some incentive to go with DTV. That said, YTTV is compelling as my experience with the DirecTV app on my legacy system and their overall abilities as a tech company are not as established as Googles. I also already have YT Red and am a big watcher of YT so that may help me consider YTTV. 

Anyways, thanks. Commercials being inserted into shows without FF will drive my wife and kids nuts so trying to get a handle on that on these new platforms.

1,2019-03-15 16:53:19,FranzKlammer,Question about Go Big & Shopping Around,"I currently pay $65/mo for Go Big + $5/mo for HBO, so $70/mo in total. I signed up probably a day before the new plans and had no idea about the massive changes they just implemented. Got my email yesterday about the $10 increase starting in May. Does that mean I can anticipate my bill going to $80/mo?   


I did some shopping around and I just can't find anything better that suits my needs. I'll list below some of my must haves:  


* All local channels (I'm in Tampa)
* Local sports channels
* Viacom - Comedy Central, Nickelodeon, etc.
* History
* HGTV
* Bravo
* NHL Network
* NFL Network
* HBO

Youtube TV is a no go for many reasons. I love the app and experience, but the channel lineup is too lacking. No native fire tv support is also a bummer. I know about the popular Philo add-on, but I prefer to keep everything in one app.   


Vue is missing viacom and I don't believe there's an NHL network option. Same complaints exist for Hulu.  


Sling is the closest thing I could find for my needs, but it is missing ABC and CBS and they dropped HBO. I could get Airtv, but again I prefer one app.  


Opinions? I know I've done a lot of the research myself, but $80/month just seems too steep. Plus, with these massive changes, I have little faith these old plans will last. I've generally had a great experience with DTVNow (aside from no native Nvidia Shield support), I just no longer trust them moving forward.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/b1h95g/question_about_go_big_shopping_around/,positive,0.2065

I have lost access to all my locals and RSNs on my Apple TV and laptop due to this.

I've been chatting with DTVN support for 2 hours, and even got a call back from their tech support. What they said was:

a) the recent storms on the east coast might be causing ISPs to reroute their internet traffic.

b) I should ask my ISP for a static IP address. I explained this was not an option. I would have to upgrade from a residential to a business account and then purchase a block of static IP addresses ... this would add big $ to my monthly internet bill.

c) I should reboot my router several times to see if I can get a new IP address assigned. I tried this several times, and keep getting the same public IP address.

d) Call my ISP to have them assign me a new IP address.

I'm waiting for a call back from my ISP to see if they can assign me a new IP address to help the situation. But I am astounded that DTVN support won't take any responsibility for this issue! DTVN's response was basically ""It's your problem, and you need to take care of it. There's nothing we can do.""

I'm posting this as an FYI in case anyone  is having similar problems. Personally, problems like these confirm that DTVN is simply not ready for prime time, and I should either try another OTT service or go back to traditional cable TV.

In that year, DTVN has DVR and all of the channels we watch. I had some questions so I did an online chat with a DTVN rep and this is what I found, coming here for validation:

Basically all channels have a 72hr rewind meaning I can start a show before it finishes to skip commercials without having to wait for it to finish (7-9p show, start watching at 8p) and have a faux-DVR for all shows within that 72hrs. 

However, he said not all channels have DVR as an option so I asked him for a list, he could not provide one. Does anyone have any insight to this?

Is it better than YTTV + Philo? 

Yeah, I know Directv Now has the interface/DVR Issues/etc, but if I was going to drop Directv Now for what everyone seems to be talking... the YTTV + Philo combination; based on my quick research, Directv Now Plus + Philo doesn’t seem to be that bad of an option!

You’d get 1080P/60 FPS with the better bit rate and 5.1 sound!

I don’t have Philo, but assuming it can work with Apple TV’s TV App, then you technically could go to TV App and find programming for both in one location (although you’d have to remember which DVR has your programs)... this same issue would exist for Apple TV users with YTTV + Philo. 

I’ll admit if you are more into sports, then YTTV may be a better bet though.

0,2018-09-30 13:15:45,Xented,FYSA: DirectTV Deceitful Tactics with Free Apple TV Promo (X-Post with Apple Subreddit),"Hello everyone,

Just wanted to let everyone know that canceling their Direct TV Now subscriptions is likely much more difficult than they originally thought.  I've included the transcript and background below.

&#x200B;

The Bottom Line Up Front (BLUF):  DirectTV Now uses deceptive tacts to keep you with the service, and then when canceling will not issues a refund for employing said tactics.  They have also risen the cost of the month-to-month by 5 dollars, not informing the consumers who have prepaid the 3 months @ 30 dollars.  **This is not about the cost of the subscription but the ridiculously unfriendly consumer attitude they have.**  

&#x200B;

Backstory:  I cancelled DirectTV Now approximately 2 weeks ago (before ending my pre-paid trail would end.  I then today  checked my account and realized that there was a charge for the next month.  I cancelled it again today, but again was frustrated by the literally four screens it took to cancel my subscription (it still wasn't cancelled).  Only after I contacted customer service did it actually go through.  

&#x200B;

I'd like to apologize for some of the wrong words used, I was using my phone and autocorrect did not assist in some cases.  Also Ron was very nice, and tried to assist within his capabilities, but frankly this is a tactic that AT&T/DirectTV is using.  

&#x200B;

Here is the transcript: 

&#x200B;

**AT\&amp;T** : Hi, I’m DIRECTV NOW's virtual assistant. How can I help you today?

**Me** : I already cancelled my plan and or charge me this month

**DIRECTV NOW** :Did you cancel the service during a free trial? 

* Yes
* No

**Me** : Yes

**DIRECTV NOW** :Accounts canceled after 7pm EST time on the last day of a free trial, will be charged for an additional month.  
**For example**: You subscribe to a 7 day trial on May 1st. If you cancel on or before May7th at 7pm ET, you will not be charged. If you cancel on May 8th, you will be charged.  
**Was this information helpful?**

* Yes
* No

**Me** : No

**DIRECTV NOW** :Let me get you to a specialist. To assist you better, please tell us your first name.

**Me** : REDACTED

**DIRECTV NOW** :Thank you. You will now be connected to a live chat specialist who will assist you.**Ron** : Hi! My name is Ron. I can help you with your account.

**Ron** : Nice to meet you, REDACTED.

**Me** : hey Ron, is like a refund for this last months billing

**Me** : I had already cancelled once and just had to cancel again

**Me** : and it was not in the last day of service

**Ron** : I understand, let me review your account and help you with the information.

**Me** : frankly your website is deceitfully hard to cancel and I foresee a class action lawsuits in your future**Me** : but I did make it through to cancellation

**Ron** : I am sorry to hear that. I have checked and see that you have canceled the service now.

**Me** : yeah I cancelled the service already two weeks ago as well, but saw a charge on my credit card this morning**Ron** : I see, let me check what best I can do for you

.**Ron** : May I know the amount and date you have been charged?

**Me** : also when signing up for the service it was 30 dollars, now it's 40. Kinda deceptive to increase the price during a free trail where you prepay for four months. All that being said I know you are not responsible for these practices.**Me** : One sec I'll get you the charge date and charge account

**Me** : amount\*

**Ron** : Sure.

**Me** : 39.45 on the 27sep

**Ron** : Thank you.,

**Ron** : I am sorry if you feel in that way, the price of the package previously was $35 and you have been charged accordingly and from effectively July 26th, the price has been increase by $5. However, you have been charged $35 plus taxes only for this month. The $40 price will be effective from next month on this account

.**Ron** : If you have canceled the account, you would have received confirmation email, have you received any confirmation email about the cancellation when you have canceled the service before?**Me** : that's fine, although deceptive. My biggest concern is that I was charged after cancelling your service. I'd imagine your going to get many complaints about this as you have to click on an account cancellation button four times, each time making it difficult to see if you actually cancelled your account. Was my account not cancelled?

 **Me** : I did get an email thank you, if still like a refund for a service I believed was cancelled

**Me** : I'd\*

**Ron** : I understand, the cancellation process would not be completed before and that might be the reason the account is not canceled.

**Me** : Why not?

**Ron** : You might not have followed the complete process for that.

**Ron** : If you have canceled the account before, you would have received cancellation email before as well.**Ron** : Have you received it when you try to cancel for the fist time?

**Me** : Okay well if highly encourage direct TV now to take a look at the cancellation process on their website. I did not receive the email with time. I'd like to think I'm pretty computer savvy.

**Ron** : I understand, I will forward this to our technical team regarding this.

**Me** : I'd like a refund please for the last month charged. 

**Ron** : Please allow me a minute here/

**Me** : Sure

**Ron** : Thank you.

**Ron** : I am sorry for the delay

.**Ron** : I was checking this for you.

**Me** : No problem

**Ron** : REDACTED, I have checked and I will refund you $20 back to your card and you will receive the amount within 5 to 7 days of maximum time.

**Me** : What? Why not the full refund? I have done nothing wing and tried to cancel my arrives but your company made that task incredibly difficult. Why am I paying 15 additional dollars for something that I had no intention of buying, and made that intention clear. 

**Me** : I'm typing on a phone, nothing wing should read anything wrong , 

**Ron** : I completely understand your concern, I really wish I had an option to refund you the complete amount. However, DIRECTV NOW do not process refunds but I understand your situation and I convenience my supervisor for the half refund.

**Ron** : However, you will still have access to stream the services.

**Me** : cancel my arrives should read cancel my service. **Ron** : I understand, I really want to help you with the full refund but I do not have an option to do that. I hope you understand my limitations.

**Me** : Wow, whelp I won't be using direct TV ever again. I'll also be posting this on Reddit as there are many users there I'd imagine who are in the same boat. Ron you have been helpful with what you can be. Thank you for your time.

 **Ron** : I completely understand your situation, I am sorry, I coudn't help you with this. I really want to help you with the refund. If I had an option I would have done that for you in the first place.

**Ron** : Can I have your billing address? So that I can authenticate your account.

**Me** : I feel as though you would, but direct TV (and AT&T) are not consumer friendly companies it seems. 

**Me** : REDACTED

**Me** : REDACTED

**Ron** : Thank you. I will forward your feedback to our management regarding this and they will look into this.**Me** : Thank you Ron have a good Sunday 

**Ron** : Thank you., I have processed the refund back to your card.

**Ron** : For future assistance please go throught our help centre : [https://help.directvnow.com/hc/en-us/articles/xxxxxxxxx-Can-I-review-my-payment-history-and-monthly-charges-](https://help.directvnow.com/hc/en-us/articles/xxxxxxxxx-Can-I-review-my-payment-history-and-monthly-charges-)

**Me** : ahh but it's not a refund 

**Me** : lol

**Ron** : I understand, I processed $20 amount.

**Ron** : REDACTED, to recap our conversation you needed help with applying the refund, I have assisted with canceling and refunded $20. Is there anything else I can help you with today? I'm happy to help you.

2,2019-04-29 08:26:51,BobsFlops,Paramount Network (and other channels) only DirecTVNow table during commercials.,"Hey everybody,

&#x200B;

maybe you observed it before but when I was watching the Paramount Network yesterday, I always had a table during the whole commercials which says ""We are right back after the short break"" or similar.

It's with the AT&T sign etc. This lasts as long as the commercial break is on.

So do they have the rights to show commercials, don't they?

&#x200B;

It's extreme on the paramount network and sometimes on the others. But not during the whole commercials like on this channel.

So is this norma having a 2-3 minutes table during commercials?

&#x200B;

Don't get me wrong that the commercials are loved by me but it's a bit strange that it's silence and only this table showing up.

I’m looking for a solution. I want Directv Now to play throughout the whole night. I understand that Directv Now has this feature in place to minimize wasted bandwidth. I believe I should b able to have the TV play throughout the entire night. When the TV Is on it helps me fall back asleep. 

From what I understand: the message pops up due to inactivity. What I want to know is there an app that will random produce activity on its own. Like maybe it could click the down arrow once. That way the 4 hour time restarts. 
I know there any may apps for Android. Maybe this would be a great thing. 

Please let me know in the comments if what you think and if you know about something similar to this

Seems strange as left/right should be skip back/forward and up/down should be channel up/down. The up/down remote clicks bring up the same app menu.

My suggestion would be the app menu should be the remote menu button and a long press of that menu button would directly bring up the program guide.  Then the left/right/up/down can be used with the more common skip back/forward and channel up/down functions.

Also - in the beta - the sound drops out when navigating a menu or the guide.  Seems like an issue with a system sound effect impacting the stream sound.

I tried to DVR a few network shows (this is not a DVR complaint) but they all end up losing about 1/3 of the show. I realized after watching live that the channels show up as “this content has an issue and can’t play” for minutes at a time. Whatever method they are using to capture local channels here is completely unwatchable right now. 

I’ve chatted with customer service several times and stated the errors I was seeing. No mention about issues with local stations. When they say they are going in to fix it, I can only assume they are refreshing/re-authorizing the account each time. They’re nice but wholly ineffective. I’d love to send in a help ticket and get an idea if this is something that could possibly be fixed in the near term or not. How to go about doing that isn’t very obvious.

Since the rollout of the new version, I haven't been able to load anything. Not the guide, not channels, nothing. Not just buffering or laggy, the blue loading bar fills the screen but I don't get anything but a black screen.

I've uninstalled the app, rebooted the Roku, and reinstalled to no luck. I've also tried just unplugging it, with a similar lack of results. The official support website offers no real solutions (Haven't contacted customer service yet), and it's getting pretty old not having been able to use a service I paid for during the last couple weeks. I really don't want to switch since I've enjoyed the service so much, but I like Roku (Every other app on mine streams perfectly) and am definitely not going to buy a different device because of DTVN's blundering.

UPDATE: After two weeks, and another chat with customer support, we went through a bunch of the same steps (Power cycling, rebooting modem, changing ID), and now it's decided to work again. No idea what actually did it, but I changed my user ID, reinstalled the app, powered down the Roku, and then rebooted my modem, and after all that I'm back to watching TV.

1,2019-01-09 23:48:23,Ventem,First impressions so far,"So I’ve been wanting to try out DirecTV Now for a while, as they have a lot of channels. Notably Viacom and AMC, which Hulu Live does not offer. I’ve been with Hulu for some time now, and have always been happy with the service. 

My first impressions were... really bad, I hate to say. 

So I signed up for the trial with the highest tier available (can’t remember what they call it) plus HBO. Awesome. Everything’s cool, and I’m excited to “channel surf” with a real channel guide. 

And my account is locked. I typed my info in correctly, and immediately my account is already locked? Weird, but whatever. Maybe I did type it in incorrectly? I was prompted to change my password, and did so. I literally changed it to the same thing (weird that their system let me change my password to the same thing) and tried again. 

Locked. 

Now I’m getting a little frustrated. Went through all that again, changed my password to something different this time, and tried again. 

You guessed it, locked out. But this time I was prompted to get a hold of customer care. Great, I’ve heard stories of AT&T’s customer care. Not looking forward to this. At all. 

They offered to reset my password for me to a temp one, and unlocked my account. Okay, cool. Maybe there was just a hiccup somewhere. Used my temp password and I’m in!! Changed my password real quick, and I was prompted to log back in. Okay, cool. This looked promising. 

I log back in and I’m locked. At this point, I’m just done. I almost wanted to ask the rep to just cancel everything and remove my payment info from the account. Before I did that, they offered to make me a new trial account. I’m super iffy about that because wouldn’t I be ineligible for a second trial with my card and be charged right away? Yes, I would. They said no, but I know how these thinks work. The system would charge me straight away. 

Before I ask them to cancel before I even got to try the service, I decided to try to login one more time. 

It worked. Suddenly, it worked. I’m baffled. I thank the rep for their time and *finally* get to try the service. 

The stream quality is great. The sheer amount of channels I get is awesome. I’m actually kind of amazed, to be honest.

Almost worth the amount of time it took just to get this shit set up. The only thing that’s really stopping me from fully switching is the lack of on-demand. Yes, they have *some*, but it’s nothing compared to Hulu’s vast library. Granted, that’s not really the purpose of DirecTV Now, so I should have expected that. 

And, of course, the fear of their obviously terrible systems screwing something up in the future. 

I’ll give it some more time, but I could probably give up some on-demand in favor of more options for live TV. 

Those who have been with DirecTV Now for a while, how are you guys liking it? Has anyone here switched from Hulu Live to DirecTV Now? I’d love to hear other’s thoughts and opinions. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/aed00w/first_impressions_so_far/,positive,0.9953

If a game is on a channel that Now does stream, you should be able to tune in. **Blackout rules apply, and Verizon maintains its exclusive streaming rights on smartphones**, so you can’t watch the NFL there.

""One of the biggest differences between Hulu's live TV service and others is that it's heavily reliant on its on-demand service as a replacement for DVR. If a user ""records"" a show that's available on Hulu's on-demand service, Hulu will simply show that user the on-demand version of that episode.

The user benefits because they'll see fewer commercials than the regular broadcast recording. Hulu says it shows less than half the number of ads as regular broadcast television. Hulu benefits because it gets to keep the ad revenue instead of the original broadcast network.""

I used the free trial a few months ago and enjoyed it. I'm counting on switching because what I'm paying for Dish right now is just too much, and DTVN is still with this news, a better offer.

So from what I understand. The ""Go Big"" and ""Gotta Have It"" plans will be going away to make way for the new ""Plus"" and ""Max"" plans, that will have less channels. Current plans will go up $10 in price effective April 12th. If I sign up today with the ""Gotta Have It"" I will see a price change next month but still keep my channels? Also if I wait too long will current plans no longer be available? 

Sorry if this was confusing to understand I tried my best to state my concerns. I just want to make sure I'm not missing a chance to get what I watch for better price. Thanks.

Can you pause/rewind live TV?
