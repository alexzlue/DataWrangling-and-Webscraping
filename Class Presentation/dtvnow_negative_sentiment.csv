Despite only playing one TV at a time, and taking great care to exit DirecTVnow to the Roku ""Home"" screen before leaving one TV for another, I am subjected to ""Too Many Streams"" errors, that persist for extended periods of time.

But, by running around the apartment like a madman, and starting DirecTVnow again, then exiting on each and every Roku, and then sitting quietly with a cup of tea and a book for about 1/2 hour,  I can then, once again, watch some news.

So, this implies 2 different problems (are you paying attention, AT&T employees?)  

&#x200B;

a) Data sync between servers is too slow - replication of ""active"" stream records are thereby different on different servers. 

b) Some ""exit"" events seem to be falling on the floor, and never being replicated to other servers, or not being ""caught"" at all, as the start app / exit app sequence on each TV seems to resolve the longer ""deadlock"" cases. 

&#x200B;

There has been a litany of complaints about ""Too Many Streams"" on all possible platforms, so this is not a Roku-specific issue.  I intend to log these incidents, and to demand credit for each and every day when this happens, thus cutting my bill in half.  If AT&T has problems of this sort, then they need to up the minimum number of streams to account for this lag in their server replication of active stream counts per account.

However my biggest issue is their apps. I love the Android Eco system and it drives me INSANE that there is still no AndroidTV app. Especially when theres a regular DirecTV AndroidTV app.

It seems clear to me after watching their Android TV box beta review, that AT&T has no intention of making a Android TV app that works outside of their Android box. I think they want to force people to pay for the box so they can profit off that. That is pure corporate greed if they do that. For people who already have Android TV it's a stab in their back. Also to make it worse the Android box won't have the traditional Android TV launcher and settings of it's released the way the beta is.

If YouTube TV, or Sling, or Playstation Vue, or anyone comes out with all my main channels I want before DirecTV comes out with an AndroidTV app, then I will switching to which ever provider that is.

19,2018-07-05 17:38:18,,DirecTVNow App on Roku is painfully slow,"Been using DirecTVNow on an Apple TV 4k for the past few months. It has had its problems with audio sometimes, but is generally really snappy. I recently purchased a Insignia 39"" HDTV for the bedroom that came with integrated Roku. I thought - cool, I won't need an ATV 4k to get to DTVN, I can just access it through the Roku on my TV.

Oh. My. God. It is so terrible. It takes over a minute to load the app, and then another 30 seconds of buffering a channel before it plays. The guide takes another minute to load, and if I navigate through the guide too quickly it will crash my whole TV. Really terrible experience. The other apps on Roku are definitely slow to launch compared to my ATV 4k, but they are all still usable. I'd categorize the DTVN now as unusable.

Are all Rokus like this?

From clicking on the DTVN app on ATV4 to actually having something on the screen is less than a second. On Roku it is about 1.5 minutes from clicking on the app to actually having something on -- If I need to change channels add another minute to that.

We've only been with DTVN for just over a month.  Beforehand we had normal DTV.  We were sick of the fees, BS, and horrible hardware.  We were customers for 10 years, no longer.

I signed us up for the $10 for 3 month DTVN promo.  A week into it we added Hulu Live as a comparison.  We didn't really care for the lack of a real guide and the wonky interface.  Hulu got downgraded before the 7 day trial was up.

Since our sign up with DTVN I've contacted support via chat only twice.  I could have contacted them over a dozen times with various problems.  The first time the problem wasn't fixed, but I was given a $10 credit (was never applied or seen in my account).  The second time was today.  That problem wasn't taken care of either, had to be escalated.  No mention of a credit, just a ""sorry you are having this issue"" after a full hour of chat.

The wife said she liked Hulu Live better even though there is no Roku guide and the interface is disorderly.  She's fed up with the DTVN problems as well, even though she only watches a couple hours a day.  We signed up for it again, it's less frustrating and has many benefits over DTVN.

We also signed up for Philo.  It gives us the remaining channels we were missing with Hulu.  Between these 2 services we have every channel we watched on DTV before we suspended our account until December.  We can record our shows and they actually show up in the list.  They are the proper shows as well, not something random like DTVN has done a couple of times.  We can actually pause shows as well, oh yeah, we can start them from the beginning as well.  Hmmm, what a concept...

Take note DTVN (and anyone else that is considering service from them).  We are paying MORE for these 2 services than we were for yours.  We have the inconvenience of having to maintain 2 bills and 2 different lists of channels, both of them without a proper traditional guide (using TitanTV for a guide), AND WE ARE HAPPIER THAN WE WERE USING YOUR SERVICE.  We will not even be finishing out the remaining 2 months at $10 each, it's just not worth it.

How do I cancel when I don't know my Log-in info?,"EDIT: /u/bochez gave me a link to customer service that connected me without having to log in. I was able to talk with customer service and it looks like I finally have my issue resolved (I'll wait until next billing cycle to confirm this). I can't thank them enough for the link. I appreciate all the help and suggestions that everyone gave in the thread!

__________________________________________________________________________________________

An AT&T employee (let's call him 'B')  signed me up for DirecTV Now without my knowing or consent. When I noticed that I was being billed for a service I did not sign up for or used I went into the the AT&T store to get it fixed. The employees there tried to fix it, however in order to do so they needed the account/log-in information (email and password). Since B was the one who created the account, he is the only one who knows the log-in information. However B was fired from AT&T and no longer works there so there was no way for us to get this log-in information.

I tried calling the DirecTV Now customer service phone line, which just says to ""address any issues via their website"" and then hangs up. On the DirecTV Now website in order to reach customer service they require you to log in (again, I am unable to do this since I do not know my account information).

So with no other options I went to my bank (Bank of America) to dispute these transactions. After I explained my issue, they quickly refunded me the money, cancelled my credit card, and sent me a new card. However the DirecTV Now charges have still been showing up every month. I have called and gotten a new Credit card 5 times this year now, but I am still being charged every month on the 3rd. Every time I call BoA, the person on the line says something along the lines of how ""it can take a few cards for it to eventually stop charging"". But every time I get a new card, the DirecTV Now charge shows up again every month on the 3rd.

I am at my wits end. This has been an incredibly frustrating experience that won't seem to end. If anyone knows any way I could get this charge to stop showing up, or someone knows how I could cancel this membership it would be greatly appreciated!",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/94t9gc/att_employee_signed_me_up_without_my_consent_how/,negative,-0.9012

Channel changing and guide browsing always felt sluggish to me, so I decided to finally try out the FireTV Pendant.

Channels change about 50% faster, but they're not instant like many Apple TV users say they are, as it still takes about 2-3 seconds for the channel to load.  

Browsing the guide is much smoother. Whereas the Firestick it would basically scroll through 5 or so channels, then pause to catch up (while also causing stuttering to the video itself) the FireTV is smooth as butter scrolling through the channels, and doesn't cause any kind of stuttering to the channel it is already on. 

Also, and this may be an issue only on my end, but my Firestick would never reliably transmit a Dolby Digital + signal, however this FireTV Pendant has no issue sending a DD+ signal to my receiver.

So in essence, for anyone in the market for a new streaming device, I'd recommend staying away from the Firestick, and getting the FireTV instead. ",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/9iv8wa/just_switched_from_firestick_2nd_gen_to_firetv/,negative,-0.8387

* Fast-forward/skip-ahead doesn't work after the first few clicks. Video freezes for undeterminate amount of time (a few seconds to several minites to indefinitely) after skipping more than 2 or 3 commercials.
* Time-remaining indicator sometimes shows double (sometimes 3x or 4x) the actual length of the show. A couple of times a 1 hour show displays 11 hours remaining. This makes it hard to skip to a specific location in the recording.
* Video quality if terrible. The same show on it's equivalent/native streaming app has much better video quality.

I switched to DirectTVNow because I was fed up with my terrible cable provider. Starting to regret my choice. Since I pre-paid for 4 months (to get the free AppleTV deal), I'll give it some more time. But if it still sucks after, I might have to try a different service.

The HBO deal is sweet for $5.. but in reality, the HBO app probably works better? It's so hard to find stuff for us. I guess point being, it's hard to find stuff.

*  if you're already on the ""my library"" screen or whatever, new recordings don't show up automatically.  You have to go out and come back in
*  the fast-forward/rewind functionality was AWFUL.  I couldn't get more accurate than within ""a few minutes"" when trying to jump to a point in the broadcast
*  the recording kept jumping backwards for no reason.   like it kept jumping back to the coin flip, over and over again.  
*  there's no way to tell the app to record more time on that channel, so with the rain delay I guess you are SOL?  you have to record the NEXT two shows or something?  That would be like 30% of the could DVR space
*  even recorded, the resolution was pretty poor and I was seeing bad quality and artifacts all over

Is this just a generic response from DTVN's email system, which does not understand additional credits? Or did they somehow remove my grandfathered plan?

I had been a DTVN customer for 10 months and had become used to dealing with constant problems. Buffering, dropped DVR recordings, app crashes, dropped channels, problems accessing On Demand programs, etc. If I went an entire day without any problems I felt elated. That only happened occasionally.

Then I noticed that FuboTV had a free 7-day trial and had virtually every channel I regularly watched. I decided to go ahead and give it a try. I was amazed. It just worked all-day, every day. No buffering or no other weird problems. I switched over to it and cancelled DTVN after the trial period expired.

Now, don't get me wrong, other than being solidly reliable it does have some issues. First of all, in spite of its beginnings as a sports oriented service, it doesn't have ESPN. That's one channel I will miss. Also, the user interface, especially for Roku devices, is a little clunky. The FireTV interface is better. I can't speak for the Apple TV interface.

Advantages - it has that pesky Hallmark Movies and Mysteries channel, the one that you lose from DTVN when you upgrade from the lowest level service. DVR recordings are very easy to set up, always work, and the minimum service allows 30 hours of recordings. In my local market, it supports the local CBS station, while DTVN didn't. On Demand program availability is extensive and works solidly. Any program you only partially watch is remembered and automatically kept for future viewing to completion.

If you are becoming frustrated with DTVN I suggest you give FuboTV a try for a service that just works.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/91fy4r/switched_to_fubotv_it_just_works/,negative,-0.7993

I'm not looking for help, just doing all I can to spread the word about how awful of a service this is.  I would rather shred $45 dollars a month than pay for this kind of service.  All I wanted to do was come home from work and watch some TV.  Instead, I get to feel like I've been robbed of my time. yay

No matter what I did it wouldn't work and I couldn't get anything other than ""Something went wrong"" as a response. After solving my issue, I have a theory. Check the TL;DR at the bottom if you just want to fix the problem.

Here is my guess. AT&T is consolidating their various services together. Anyone who does this for a living on the server side knows what a nightmare it is to accomplish. When AT&T integrated DirecTV NOW, they screwed up the authentication chain. Your DirecTV NOW password is ""good"", but it doesn't match your main AT&T password. I would suspect AT&T authenticates DirecTV NOW, then uses the same secure password hash to authenticate into their main system and it fails. That's why if you put in a wrong DirecTV NOW password, you get a different error message.

    Your password -> converted to secure hash -> authentication success at DirecTV NOW -> forward secure hash to AT&T account -> failure

I noticed that after trying it a lot in a short period of time. My DirecTV NOW account got locked out for invalid password attempts even though I was cutting and pasting it. I confirmed I was able to use the cut/paste to log in to the DirecTV NOW website.

I reset my password at DirecTV NOW and noticed it said my password would change for all AT&T services. Sure enough, I tried to log in to my main AT&T account with my AT&T password and got a bad password error. I used the DirecTV NOW password and got right in. So, reset your AT&T password using the DirecTV NOW site (just to be sure they properly propagate it through the system). After that, you should be able to use your new password to successfully authenticate HBOGo.

&#x200B;

**TL;DR - Change / Reset your password on the** [**directvnow.com**](https://directvnow.com) **site. It will change your main** [**att.com**](https://att.com) **password too, but it will fix the ""Something went wrong"" error you are getting. Also, ensure you log in to the DirecTV NOW website with a browser to finish setting up your account (create security questions, etc.).**

&#x200B;

**edit: My passwords are the same on DirecTV NOW and AT&T. I also merged all my accounts within AT&T, using the consolidator on their website. That could have affected things too.**",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/9fj37h/hbogo_not_activating_something_went_wrong/,negative,-0.8316

I assume DTVN doesn't have any trouble streaming it....which is why I want to stick with them.

Unfortunately the damn guide simply will not load. I've power cycled the ATV4, closed the DTVN app, and everything else I know to do and it simply won't load. I simply get the flashing, blank guide.

We tried several options and each one of them so far (Sling, PSVue, Hulu Live TV, etc.) have failed to hit some minimums.

DirecTV Now is the current test and, so far, I'm a bit surprised at what I'm seeing and not seeing.

1. Can you not pause a channel and then continue on??? Every channel I've tried allows me to Pause, but the moment I hit play again it just jumps to live again missing the period where I was paused. That's a rather useless ""feature"". Am I using it wrong?
2. MANY of the features I'm seeing just fail to work. I keep selecting programming (with the down button) to play and virtually all of them say there was an error and that the programming isn't able to be played. The trial is the full package trial.
3. The NBCSN channel. Does anyone know if it's local? In other words, I'm in the Philly market. The cable version of this channel will get you Phillies, Sixers and Flyers games. Will this be the same?

I decided to test $65 package and get a free roku stick if I pay for a month up front.   

I had issues logging in due to lastpass pulling my old ATTid so i had to chat to get all that resolved.   Got it figured out and logged in using chrome. 

Well, chrome in a regular window would not load video on my PC and I had to use incognito.  This seems fishy from the get go. 

Next i wanted to try the DTVN app on my Samsung Smart TV.   It came pre-installed with DTVN Beta App and it would not work at all.   Got logged in and it threw error ""something is wrong, try again later"" and the only option is close it, re-open, log in again and get same error.   Now im getting annoyed.   

Also having an issue on android phone saying it cant find location even though the app has location service perms and i have tried all 3 location modes. 


I chatted with support this morning and they suggest I 'reboot your modem/router' (typically IT line) and they 'refreshed my account'.   Support said it should work on samsung but still in beta so expect bugs and still no date to roll out a stable build.

Ill try 'turning the internet off/on again' tonight and see what happens. 

On top of that, seeing that i added the free roku stick and paid up front they will not give me a refund.  I my haste I overlooked the fine print.  They did drop my bill $5 for 2 months for my issues but i would have thought they had this tech figured out by now.   

Not happy thus far.   

Anyone else having these issues?

edit:  last night had same error (hmm something went wrong, try again later) on dtvn app on fire tv 4k ultra device.   Still only worked on chrome incognito and i had close and reopen chrome a couple times before video would load.   chatted (4th time in under 24hrs) with support to see if it was something on my router that could be changed and got not answers.   was told my case has be elevated to technical team and have now been given a total of $15 off my next 2 billing cycles, which holds no water as i will be cancelling and testing PlayStation Vue.

No major reason, just several minor ones (lagging, poor on-demand selection, several poor customer service interactions). I decided to cancel right at the end of a billing cycle and before I went out of town for 2 weeks. I clicked cancel on the manage account section and was taken to a second screen that looked like a confirmation screen, with an option to return to manage account. I clicked that and figured that was the end of it. 

I come back from vacation and noticed my CC had been charged for the next billing cycle. I log back and go through the cancellation process again - this time I notice that after clicking the cancel button on the manage account screen the next screen which I assumed was a confirmation screen there is another much  smaller text hyperlink below that says click here to officially cancel. The text is small so it’s easy to miss.

Now, I understand that this is definitely my own fault - I should have been more careful and noticed that I had to click through again and should have noticed the lack of confirmation email. But the layout of these screens is definitely deceiving, and I can see people making the same mistake.

Some of these channels are blacked out as I’m not located in that market. I’ve chatted with DTVN frequently regarding the issue and have received wildly different responses. The most typical response is that my IP address is to blame. While being a dynamic ip, it hasn’t changed since the update. It’s geolocation using most third party services is in my city. DTVN recommends contacting my isp to request an ip with geolocation in my city. My dynamic ip that could put me in another city at any moment, per DTVN sources. Their guaranteed fix is a static ip at this point. 

All that being said, this is occurring at the same time as a google geolocation api price increase. Coincidence? Perhaps. 

What’s frustrating is that the geolocation issues began with the beta. DTVN was aware but chose to release it. And once the update is loaded, location is a toss up. 

Here are the questions I can’t seem to find an answer for. Why didn’t DTVN correct the problem in beta? Did DTVN previously use billing zip or google geolocation api or...? Why can’t they make the previous app available for for those experiencing geolocation issues? It’s already been a solid month, how much more patience do DTVN customers need to have?

5,2018-09-20 20:23:58,wdmccoll,High Data usage with DTVN,"  

The question is does DTVN use significantly more data than comparable streaming plans?

My internet connection is thru Comcast, with a 1,024GB “cap”. I’m fairly new to cordcutting, began with Sling and after 3 mos. switched to DVTN at the end of August, wooed by their introductory offer.

Now I am getting warnings from Comcast about my data usage. Not yet a full month but looking back historically, it seems my data use could almost double at my current September rate. 

I do not have a 4k tv, just one tv receiving HD at up to 1080. No daytime tv except weekends, mainly for sports.

Using Comcast’s Estimator with generous inputs, my usage figures out to an estimated 560GB per month which is exactly what I did in August with Sling. The month of July, with Sling only (streaming at highest quality), was 520GB. So, no big difference in total usage time, only change is the streaming provider with more channels, including local channels.

According to Comcast, 99% of customers don't come close to a terabyte per month. I should be able to stream between 600 and 700 hours of HD video and I am not even half of that. No way I am in the top 1%.

One gripe about DTVN is that everything is slow, there are wait times to load. Is this system loading just bad design that results in higher data usage? Even so, it could not be a 90% increase!",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/9hinjo/high_data_usage_with_dtvn/,negative,-0.9041

I have never paid a full months service because of issues that keep happening. I noticed about 20 days ago I no longer have the option for chat once I log in. It seems to have happened after an issue has a raised a little over a month ago. I no longer get my locals. I live in the Tpa market but I get Jax locals.. They kept telling me it would be fixed.. they called my cell to confirm such.. Every week I would enter into chat because the issue wasn't fixed. Its the main reason I have this service. Well about 2 weeks ago they said they were updating the servers in my area and it would be fixed for sure within 24 hrs. Well 24,48,72 hrs had passed and still no fix.. went to go to the chat and poof its no longer there.. I again tried today and still no longer there.. 

Seems like a little bit of bullshit that they don't have a phone number to call to fix issues but okay.. When you start taking the chat away thats just downright horse shit.. 

Has this happened to anyone else..

And on a side note, my ""true cloud dvr"" bullshit no longer loads and just says ""Well, that was unexpected.

Contacted DTVN's useless live chat and they gave me the crap about how blackouts work and said there was nothing they could do.

I decided to take advantage of the apple tv deal and cancel sling. I have both Roku and Apple tv devices at home. My initial login was on a roku device. This was apparently inbetween direct TV updating their streams and apps. When I initially logged in I had access to all of my local affiliates. Horray! I live in a rural area in PA and no streaming service had any locals up to this point. According to the zip code check i should have fox but nothing else. So yesterday the app updates and i only have access to fox. I'm a little disappointed, but never expect the other channels to remain available.

That leads me to the second part. The new roku update includes the dvr and new features, but is clearly buggy. Something must be wrong with tje Pied Piper algorithm. It is kinda at an unwatchable level for me with frequent screen flickering and generally low resolution and responsiveness. These issues are not present when watching on Apple TV. I'm assuming an update will fix the problems with Roku.

I just couldn't see paying almost $70 a month for all those channels we don't use. Now to the complaints DirectTv Now  on Roku is horrible! It takes forever to load then once it finally does you have to wait for the guide to load. Next the constant buffering is enough to make a preacher swear! I hoped with every update that the app would get better and really it seemed to only get worse. How can a $20 television package work better than a $70 one? I'll never understand but somehow it does! Philo has all the channels we watch except for Disney and Cartoon Network for the kids but we can use Grandma's Spectrum info to watch those on the apps. And then there's the horrible DVR! I was a DirecTV Now customer for several months but I just couldn't see paying for a service so poor any longer. If AT&T doesn't start caring more I think they probably will continue to lose customers, especially if other cheaper services keep adding channels like Philo has been. I also have Hulu and Netflix and my antenna for locals so I'm not missing anything I care about.

0,2018-10-27 03:39:31,NorthOaksGirl,DirecTV NOW Service Complaint results in first-ever refund?," I took advantage of DirecTV NOW's 1-week free trial and was satisfied enough with the allover       product to enroll in a paid contract-free month of service.  
 

Nightmare time! (1) What I selected to record to my library (cloud  storage) was 90% unplayable, despite constant attempts to run  them. (2) The few recordings which did play back could not be       deleted - DTN literally returned them to my library with each attempt to delete! - thus sitting on 6 precious hours of the tiny 20  hours of allotted cloud storage. (3) Programs I slated to record would not accept a change of mind: I could not stop the weekly recording event So, every week I saw another 3 hours of my 20  hours of cloud storage add on without any ability to actually watch those programs.

I wrote the first of three long chat discussions with DTN's Customer Service Team: a phone number is not an option for DTN customers as folks would be yelling at the poor reps all day and night! But I wanted chat, as it would leave a written transcript behind. I am glad I kept them. A case number was assigned, all details noted, and promises made to have the issues resolved  within the week. What I could not know was that this was the routine response to any and all customer complaints: make       promises, keep the customer attached to the account, take their money.

It is my belief that selling 'vapor ware' (software or programming  that does not exist except in the mind of the designer) is not only reprehensible but entirely unethical and can never be justified. I ended my third chat session with the comment to the poor rep that they must feel terrible knowing that, should they wish to keep their job, they can in no way make a promise to provide a refund. 

I tested this request but coming at the issue again and again: let me cut free, refund my money for three continued weeks of poor to non-existent service, and let me come back in six weeks. Again and  again the rep would reply that the Beta version was coming soon, almost ready, close to completion. ""Soon."" They would never define the word ""soon"" for me and I finally closed the third chat session       without telling the rep we were done.

I contacted my payment source, PayPal Credit, employed deliberately for the protection I knew PayPal would provide for poor product design, failure to deliver, etc. PayPal filed a case for me with DirecTV NOW two weeks ago, and I learned today that my refund was coming in.

The money is now in my PayPal account, making me (I believe) the  first person who has complained about DTN to actually get their  money back.

3,2019-03-15 03:44:12,terryjohnson16,I dont intend to cancel...yet heres why,"I have the grandfathered $40 go big plan. Used to be $35. But i dont see the hype in the other competitors options. I looked at youtube tv offers, hulu tv etc and they all are missing channels that directv now offers the grandfathered plan members. Some are missing viacom channels while others are missing other major channels. Not one streaming company offers every major channel/network. They all have pieces of the pie and it gets you to think and choose which to take and at what price. 

If i switch i will losing more by switching. Yeah the price increased by $10 but the value is still for us grandfathered plan members. Value was still there even after they stopped allowing people to get the old $35/$40 grandfathered go big plan. That plan alone was $65. At that price its not worth it. 

I plan on hopefully keeping my grandfathered go big plan until they try to over price it. I have some people I recommended it to after their spectrum tv bill was reaching $200. 

Att wants people to drop the service so its less money they pay to the companies. 

Since the price increase rumor, people have been selling their $40 go big account here on reddit in record numbers. 

We all know att isn’t done yet raising their prices and channel reductions. 

Too bad the people that approve the stupid mergers don’t see how they companies lie just to get that approval. I wish there would be a scandal of how these companies pay/bribe the admins into these approvals. 

Im not a fan of john legere and the tmobile staff staying in trump hotels just to butter them up to get the merger approved with sprint but thats another topic...

Problems include:

1. The DVR records shows that I didn’t ask it to
2. DVR randomly deletes episodes or entire shows that I asked it to record, even when there’s lots of space left
3. Recorded shows skip frames
4. Some recorded episodes are only minutes long. It records part of the “previously on”, then some commercials, then the recording is done
5. When trying to watch a recorded episode, I am frequently met with passive-aggressive pop ups saying “Looks like something’s wrong with your internet. Try again later”, even though my internet is fine and I can watch Netflix, Hulu and DirecTV Live with no issues. Other companies utilize more user-friendly wording, such as “Something went wrong. We’re working on fixing it.” The wording rubs me the wrong way because I’m already irritated lol

&#x200B;

I have a tv show series (Hoarders on A&E) that I have subscribed to. If I watch an episode, I am forced to watch six (6) consecutive commercials every few minutes.

&#x200B;

My wife and I enjoy watching the show, but don't care to watch the cleanup part, and in the past, would skip to the end of the show to see the final result.

&#x200B;

If we start watching the episode and want to skip to the end, I'm now forced to watch FIVE (5) SETS OF SIX (6) COMMMERCIALS so we can watch the last 10 minutes of the episode. So, I have to watch THIRTY (30) COMMERCIALS , which is roughly FIFTEEN (15)  MINUTES OF COMMERCIALS for FIFTEEN (15) MINUTES OF ACTUAL PROGRAMMING.

&#x200B;

We PAY for a subscription but DIRECTV NOW is double-dipping and getting paid by advertisers too! DTVN is competitive with traditional cable, but the service is far more restrictive than any other cable provider and this will ultimately FORCE US TO CANCEL OUR ACCOUNT!

&#x200B;

To sit down and try to watch 15 minutes of programming with my wife while my kids run around makes the service completely useless for us. It shouldn't take 30 minutes to see 15 minutes worth of TV.

So I tried to validate my phone number and I got an error saying something stupid to the effect that I somehow couldn't add HBO to this plan.  It was a really stupid error message, but I digress.  In any case, I foolishly thought that if I somehow removed HBO from my current subscription, and then tried to re-validate my phone number, then I would get the bonus.  Of course that did not work.  After that I went back and tried to re-add HBO back to my sub, and low and behold, I could't add anything.  

&#x200B;

Come today, I can add HBO back to my plan, but the goddamn thing is now $15 and not the grandfathered rate.  I talked to the tech support folks in the horrible online chat window, and of course they couldn't do anything.  Does anyone have any recommendation?  Is there an actual number I can call?

Sometimes they show up again in the Roku app, but mostly not, depending on the mood of the app at that time.

* There is no way to ""delete-protect"" recordings, other providers let users designate recordings from being deleted by newer recordings

* While the 100 hours DVR option supposedly has been released, I have not seen any such option to upgrade to that. And even if it was there, if the plan is still to delete recordings automatically after 90 days, then a 100-hour function would be useless anyway, as at least I do not have that much time to watch 100 hours’ worth of recordings in any one 90-day period. There should be no automatic deleting, unless so much is recorded that space is needed by overwriting the oldest recording (unless that was designated as “do not delete”. All these fucntions have been available by legacy TV providors (cable, fiber, etc.) for ages.

* Volume differs greatly from one channel to another on DTVN and is generally much louder than other sources (PlayStation, etc.), requiring serious volume adjustments made ahead of switching to DTVN to keep from experiencing a volume-shock. Other apps on that same Roku like Hulu and Sling and Netflix put out volume in line with other sources, showing again that DTVN is at fault.

If it was not for the fact that the two really important parts of this DTVN service, picture quality and channel availability, are better than that of most other tested providers, there would be no reason to use DTVN due to the numerous annoyances and bugs and the fact that there is no way to even tell DTVN about it due to lack of a contact method, other than the helpless people who answer the useless “chat” option from a country on the other side of the globe.

I would bet you'll see increases for Hulu announced soon.

I'd venture to guess this is because many of the networks are losing viewers due to cord cutting and other entertainment leading to lower viewership ratings. 

Networks (like A&E, MTV, USA, etc)  make money in two ways. Ads, which they charge the advertisers for, and the fees they charge the MVPDs (cable and satellite companies) per user to carry the network.

As fewer people are watching tv (because of netflix, video games, internet etc) the networks bring in lower revenue from advertisers, who pay per eyeball.  Obviously, if a channel is seeing lower ratings, they won't pay as much because the ad isn't hitting as many potential target watchers. [https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/20/how-do-cable-companies-make-their-money.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2015/04/20/how-do-cable-companies-make-their-money.html)

The other way networks make money is by charging the MVPD/cable/satellite providers per user. Often this is pennies,  but can go up to $7 for networks like ESPN. ([https://blogs.wsj.com/numbers/how-much-cable-subscribers-pay-per-channel-1626/](https://blogs.wsj.com/numbers/how-much-cable-subscribers-pay-per-channel-1626/) They charge this whether you watch or not.

The networks, seeing lower ad revenue are re-negotiating these per user rates with the MVPDs to be higher. Otherwise, the network would be losing money. In turn, all of the Virtual MVPDs are having to raise the prices that the consumers (you and I) pay or risk losing money because they would be paying the networks more than they bring in.

The one thing I noticed is DirecTV Now calls for the highest amount of bandwidth then other streaming services. It also may hold more concurrent connections off to their servers. My theory boils down to the routers people are using.

I’d like to see some posts of the people that are having problems, what router are you guys using. And a posting from other people with no problems, what router are they using.

0,2018-06-24 23:55:11,JoyousGamer,Have a FireTV and AppleTV? Use the FireTV,"First off know that I am not the biggest fan of the AppleTV to start with. The touch controls I feel cause a input delay I don't get from my other devices.

I am just throwing this out there after using my AppleTV for the first time for DTVN in about a month and a half. The AppleTV app is so inferior its not even funny. (To be clear my AppleTV has been used for HBO/Netflix with no issues so this is not a device issue)

For clarity: On the same network, both on wifi (ATV is actually closer than the FireTV), and been a DTVN subscriber since day 1 (I know how to fix issues and what is ""common"" for my house).

Issues I had
-
- DVR was slow, dropping half the show, and had lots of buffering (example I stopped a show in the middle, went upstairs to the APTV [had to log in], and had these issues on that same episode as well as others I tried)
- Needing to login multiple times (known issue)
- Extra ordinary additional buffering on live tv typically not on FireTV (was not watching a sporting event just normal rerun shows)
- This is personal but swipe not showing the Watch Now/Guide is extremely annoying (it asks for you to push the Menu button)
- Apple TV got stuck in the DVR section of the app with incorrect screen display (DVR show information overlaps the headers)

This is not meant to tear down the service but simply to point out at this point if you have the choice between devices use the FireTV. Its been about a month since I used the Roku (had Beta but not the live version) and I would say if that hasn't changed that Roku would be a better option as well.",https://www.reddit.com/r/DirecTVNow/comments/8tm1k0/have_a_firetv_and_appletv_use_the_firetv/,negative,-0.444
